    "momentum": "RSI overbought at 70.92, MACD strongly bullish (90.1 > 76.83) with positive histogram (13.27), ADX at 29.78 showing developing trend strength with +DI > -DI (31.09 > 13.08), Stochastic extremely overbought (K:95.49, D:91.06), CCI overbought at 152.48",

    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish momentum with clear breakout continuation - price above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, closing near session highs, maintaining above-cloud positioning with strengthening trend indicators and new highs above 4640",
    "key_drivers": [
      "EMA_BULL_STACK signal with price above all key EMAs confirming robust bullish structure",
      "MACD strongly bullish with positive histogram (13.27) confirming momentum acceleration",
      "High volatility regime (84.2%) supporting momentum continuation with mean-reverting properties",
      "Positive accumulation (0.5886) indicating sustained institutional buying pressure",
      "New high at 4642.69 breaking above previous resistance levels",
      "Supportive cross-asset environment with SPX above cloud, VIX low volatility, and DXY consolidation"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates powerful breakout continuation with today's action showing new highs at 4642.69 and strong technical momentum. The MACD maintains strong bullish configuration with positive histogram (13.27), while positive accumulation (0.5886) indicates institutional participation remains robust. Price maintains position above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal and closed strongly despite overbought conditions. The high volatility regime (84.2%) combined with mean-reverting properties supports continued momentum. Cross-asset analysis reveals a favorable environment with SPX maintaining bullish positioning above cloud, VIX in low volatility regime indicating low fear, and DXY consolidating rather than strengthening significantly. While technical indicators show overbought conditions (RSI 70.92, Stochastic extreme), the overall structure supports continuation of the breakout regime.",
    "confidence": 0.87,
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI overbought at 70.92 and Stochastic extremely overbought (K:95.49) suggest near-term pullback risk",
      "High volatility regime (84.2%) may lead to sharp reversals or increased price swings",
      "CCI overbought at 152.48 indicates potential momentum exhaustion",
      "Dollar index consolidation could turn supportive for USD if breaks higher from current levels",
      "VIX low volatility regime may indicate complacency that could reverse suddenly",
      "Consolidation probability at 0.5 suggests potential for pause within the broader breakout trend"
