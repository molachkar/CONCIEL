    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4586.81, made a high of 4642.69, low of 4586.57 and closed at 4626.06. The close sits well above all major EMAs (E9 4522.15, E21 4435.75, E50 4285.37) and above the VWAP (4436.37). PSAR is far below price (4313.21), confirming strong bullish pressure. Volume was high (359,180).",
    "momentum": "RSI 70.92 (overbought), MACD line 90.1 above signal 76.83 with a large positive histogram (+13.27), ADX 29.78 with +DI 31.09 > -DI 13.08 indicating a solid uptrend. Stochastic K/D 95.49/91.06 (overbought), WILLR -4.51 (near neutral), CCI 152.48 (overbought).",
    "volatility": "Volatility regime is high (VOL_PCT 82.95%). Hurst 0.3541 indicates a mean‑reverting state despite the strong move. Efficiency 0.3591 and accumulation 0.5886 show that volatility is being channeled into directional buying pressure.",
    "cross_assets": "DXY weak/neutral (IN_CLOUD, CCI overbought) supporting gold. S&P500 bullish but showing a weak trend (ADX 11.54, +DI 21.22 > -DI 19.94). VIX low and bearish (IN_CLOUD, low volatility). Overall macro backdrop remains risk‑on."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is in a strong bullish breakout, maintaining price well above all key moving averages, the 20‑day Bollinger middle, and the VWAP, while PSAR sits far below price. Momentum indicators are firmly bullish and the high‑volume, high‑accumulation environment supports continued upside.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Close at 4626.06 above all major EMAs and VWAP.",
      "MACD bullish crossover with a large positive histogram (+13.27).",
      "RSI 70.9 and Stochastic >90 indicating strong momentum (despite overbought status).",
      "ADX 29.8 with +DI dominance confirming a solid uptrend.",
      "High volume and positive accumulation (0.5886) in a high‑volatility regime.",
      "Weak dollar (DXY) and bullish equity market (S&P500) provide a risk‑on backdrop."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The price action shows a decisive advance into the upper Bollinger range, breaking above the previous session high and staying above all major trend lines. Momentum metrics (MACD, RSI, ADX) are all bullish, and the high‑volume, high‑accumulation environment indicates strong buying interest. Cross‑asset signals reinforce the picture: a softening dollar and a bullish equity market support gold, while low VIX reflects limited fear. Together these factors point to a breakout regime.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI and Stochastic are in overbought territory, raising the risk of a short‑term pull‑back.",
      "Price is approaching the upper Bollinger Band (BBU 4639.47) and recent intraday highs, which could act as near‑term resistance.",
      "High volatility (≈83% of typical volume) may produce sharp reversals or false breakouts.",
      "A sudden rebound in the dollar index could remove a key supportive factor for gold."
