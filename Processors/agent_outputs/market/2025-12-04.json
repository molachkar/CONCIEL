    "trend": "Strong bullish trend continuation with healthy pullback to support, maintaining above all EMAs, bullish Ichimoku cloud positioning, and supportive momentum indicators",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200)",

    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates breakout continuation despite testing support at 4175.01. Price remains well above all major moving averages with strong momentum indicators (RSI 61.22, MACD bullish). The successful test of support and recovery to close at 4207.41 shows underlying strength. High volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. Cross-asset signals remain favorable with VIX decline to new lows and DXY showing continued weakness/consolidation, creating optimal conditions for gold appreciation. The pullback appears to be healthy consolidation within the broader breakout structure.",
