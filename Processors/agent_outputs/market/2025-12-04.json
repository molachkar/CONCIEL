    "momentum": "Gold shows strong momentum with RSI at 61.22 and MACD histogram positive (5.9). ADX at 20.9 indicates a strengthening trend.",
    "volatility": "Gold is in a high volatility regime (VOL_PCT 80.87). S&P500 is also in a high volatility regime (VOL_PCT 80.25). VIX is in a high volatility regime (VOL_PCT 68.4). DXY is in a low volatility regime (VOL_PCT 7.69).",
    "cross_assets": "Gold is above its cloud and showing bullish EMA stacking. S&P500's data suggests high volatility but no clear trend. VIX's high volatility regime suggests potential for increased market uncertainty. DXY's low volatility indicates lack of directional bias."

    "regime": "RISK_ON",
    "trend": "Gold is in a strong uptrend, supported by bullish technicals and high volatility. S&P500's high volatility suggests potential for movement, but no clear trend is indicated. VIX's high volatility could signal increasing uncertainty, but current levels are not extreme. DXY's low volatility removes a potential headwind for risk assets.",

    "reasoning": "The combination of Gold's strong uptrend, S&P500's high volatility (potential for movement), and DXY's inactivity suggests a RISK_ON environment. VIX's high volatility is noted but not currently extreme enough to counter the risk-on signals.",
