    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish trend continuation with accelerating momentum, maintaining above all EMAs, bullish Ichimoku cloud positioning, and strengthening momentum indicators with new highs above 4350",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200)",
      "Above cloud positioning with strong Ichimoku signals and positive accumulation (0.529)",
      "RSI at 68.93 showing strong bullish momentum with room for further upside",
      "MACD histogram acceleration to 5.98 indicating renewed bullish momentum",
      "DXY extreme weakness closing at 97.97 with oversold conditions and BB breakout down supporting gold appreciation"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates strong breakout continuation with new highs above 4350, closing at 4298.7 with significant intraday range. Price remains well above all major moving averages with strengthening momentum indicators (RSI 68.93, MACD histogram 5.98). ADX at 23.19 shows developing trend strength with strong directional movement (+DI 31.28). The successful defense of the 4256 level and close near session highs shows underlying strength. Medium volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. Cross-asset signals remain highly favorable with DXY showing extreme weakness (RSI 30.71) with BB breakout down and VIX remaining at relatively low levels despite intraday spike, creating optimal conditions for gold appreciation. The acceleration aligns with the broader breakout structure observed in previous days.",
