    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4457.5, made a high of 4479.4, low of 4407.48 and closed at 4477.56 on very high volume (341,414). The close is above the prior day (4455.64) and sits above all key EMAs (E9 4426.02, E21 4367.05, E50 4233.98). Bollinger middle band is 4377.39, price is well above it. PSAR sits at 4500.35, above the price, indicating short‑term bearish pressure.",
    "momentum": "RSI 63.13 (bullish), MACD line 68.22 just above signal 68.14 (histogram +0.08), ADX 27.44 with +DI 24.91 > -DI 17.11 (moderate uptrend). Stochastic K/D ~73, WILLR -26 (still bearish but improving). EMA stack is bullish (SIG: EMA_BULL_STACK).",
    "volatility": "Volatility regime is high (VOL_PCT 83.37%). Hurst 0.3697 suggests a mean‑reverting state. Efficiency 0.33 and accumulation 0.6856 indicate strong buying pressure despite choppiness.",
    "cross_assets": "DXY is weak/neutral (IN_CLOUD, CCI_OB, WILL_OB) supporting gold. S&P500 is bullish (EMA_BULL_STACK, ABOVE_CLOUD) but shows a weak trend. VIX is low and bearish (EMA_BEAR_STACK, BELOW_CLOUD) indicating low market fear. Overall macro backdrop is risk‑on."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is in a bullish breakout phase, extending above recent consolidation levels and maintaining its position above all major moving averages. Underlying uptrend remains intact despite short‑term PSAR pressure.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Price closed above prior day and above all EMAs, confirming bullish structure.",
      "MACD bullish cross (histogram turning positive) and RSI >60 signal strong momentum.",
      "ADX >25 with +DI dominance confirms an ongoing uptrend.",
      "Weak DXY and bullish S&P500 provide a supportive risk‑on environment.",
      "High volume and positive accumulation (0.6856) indicate strong buying interest."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The combination of a decisive price advance, bullish momentum indicators, and a supportive cross‑asset backdrop points to a continuation breakout. Although the PSAR sits above price, suggesting short‑term bearish pressure, the overall technical picture (EMA stack, MACD cross, RSI, ADX) and the high‑volume, high‑accumulation environment outweigh that signal, placing gold in a breakout regime.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "PSAR above price may trigger a short‑term pull‑back if sellers gain momentum.",
      "High volatility (83% of typical volume) can produce sharp reversals or false breakouts.",
      "Approaching the upper Bollinger Band (BBU 4549.75) could act as near‑term resistance.",
      "MACD histogram is still small (+0.08); a reversal could quickly turn it negative.",
      "A sudden rebound in the dollar would remove a key supportive factor for gold."
