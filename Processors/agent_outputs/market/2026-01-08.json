    "price_action": "Gold closed strong at 4477.56 (up from open 4457.5) after trading between 4407.48-4479.4, maintaining position above all key EMAs (E9:4426.02, E21:4367.05, E50:4233.98, E200:3714.94) with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, STRONG_UP designation, and ABOVE_CLOUD positioning, showing breakout continuation with strong recovery from intraday low",
    "momentum": "RSI bullish at 63.13, MACD bullish crossover confirmed (68.22 > 68.14) with positive histogram (0.08), ADX at 27.44 showing developing trend strength with +DI > -DI (24.91 > 17.11), Stochastic bullish (K:73.85, D:73.15)",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 84.41%, PARK_VOL: 0.013) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3697), ATR of 85.39 showing wide daily ranges, very positive accumulation (0.6856) indicating strong institutional buying",

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish momentum with clear breakout continuation - price above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, closing near session highs, and maintaining above-cloud positioning with strengthening trend indicators",
    "key_drivers": [
      "MACD bullish crossover confirmed with positive histogram (0.08) reversing previous negative divergence",
      "Very high positive accumulation (0.6856) indicating strong institutional buying pressure and trend sustainability",
      "EMA_BULL_STACK signal with price above all key EMAs confirming robust bullish structure",
      "High volatility regime (84.41%) supporting momentum continuation with mean-reverting properties",
      "Supportive cross-asset environment with SPX bullish, VIX oversold, and DXY consolidation",
      "Strong recovery from intraday low 4407.48 to close at 4477.56 shows dip-buying enthusiasm"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates strong breakout continuation with today's action showing significant technical improvements. The MACD bullish crossover with positive histogram (0.08) resolves previous momentum concerns, while extremely high accumulation (0.6856) indicates robust institutional participation. Price maintains position above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal and closed near session highs despite testing lower levels intraday. The high volatility regime (84.41%) combined with mean-reverting properties supports continued momentum. Cross-asset analysis reveals a favorable environment with SPX maintaining bullish structure, VIX deeply oversold indicating low fear, and DXY in consolidation phase. Technical indicators show room for further upside without overbought conditions, confirming the breakout regime remains intact.",
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "risk_factors": [
      "High volatility regime (84.41%) may lead to sharp reversals or increased price swings",
      "PSAR resistance at 4500.35 provides near-term technical hurdle",
      "Stochastic approaching overbought territory (K:73.85) may indicate near-term exhaustion",
      "Consolidation probability at 0.5 suggests potential for pause within the broader breakout",
      "DXY showing BB_SQUEEZE and CCI_OB could signal impending dollar move that may pressure gold",
      "VIX oversold conditions (WILL_OS, MFI_OS) may indicate complacency that could reverse"
