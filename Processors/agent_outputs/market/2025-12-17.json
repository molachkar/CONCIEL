  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is in a strong uptrend, supported by bullish technicals and medium volatility. S&P500 is consolidating with a slight bearish bias. VIX and DXY are not providing strong counter signals.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Gold's bullish EMA stacking and medium volatility",
      "S&P500's neutral but slightly bearish stance",
      "VIX's neutral levels despite minor uptick",
      "DXY's low volatility and lack of directional bias"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The combination of Gold's strong uptrend, S&P500's consolidation, and neutral fear (VIX) suggests a BREAKOUT environment. DXY's inactivity removes a potential headwind for risk assets.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "Gold's overbought conditions (RSI 71.91, CCI 151.05, WILL -7.99)",
      "Potential mean-reversion in medium volatility regimes",
