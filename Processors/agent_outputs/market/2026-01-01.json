    "price_action": "No direct price data available for 2026-01-01. Based on the last available close (2025-12-31) gold was at 4317.2, near the 20‑day Bollinger middle band, with the PSAR positioned above price, indicating short‑term bearish pressure.",
    "momentum": "No direct RSI/MACD/ADX values for today. The previous day showed RSI 52.7 (neutral), MACD histogram -8.55 (bearish), ADX 31.5 with +DI > -DI (strong uptrend). These suggest lingering bullish trend despite near‑term weakening momentum.",
    "volatility": "No volatility metrics for today. The last recorded regime was high volatility (VOL_PCT ~78%) with low efficiency, implying the market remains prone to rapid moves.",
    "cross_assets": "No fresh cross‑asset data. DXY was weakening (close ~97.97, RSI 34, -DI > +DI), S&P 500 modestly lower, and VIX low (~16.5) with bearish MACD, all pointing to a risk‑on backdrop supporting gold."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "RISK_ON",
    "trend": "Short‑term pull‑back within a broader up‑trend. Underlying bullish bias remains (strong ADX, weakening dollar, low VIX), but price is near key support (20‑day SMA, POC) and shows signs of near‑term correction.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Strong ADX (>30) with +DI dominance confirming an underlying uptrend",
      "Weakening US dollar (DXY) removing head‑winds for gold",
      "Low VIX indicating complacent risk sentiment",
      "High volatility regime providing room for a directional move once the pull‑back resolves"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Even though gold is trading near its 20‑day Bollinger middle band and the PSAR sits above price, the macro backdrop remains risk‑on: the dollar is in a downtrend, equity markets are relatively stable, and fear metrics are low. The persistent strong ADX signal suggests the broader uptrend is intact, making the current price action more consistent with a short‑term correction rather than a regime shift.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "Negative MACD histogram and PSAR above price could signal a deeper near‑term reversal",
      "RSI hovering around neutral (~53) may indicate loss of bullish momentum",
      "High volatility could trigger rapid swings or false breakouts",
      "Any unexpected dollar strength rebound would cap gold upside"
