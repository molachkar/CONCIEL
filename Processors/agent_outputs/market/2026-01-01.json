    "key_drivers": [
      "Technical file system error prevents current data analysis",
      "Recent consolidation pattern from Dec 30-31 suggests continued digestion phase",
      "DXY weakness historically supportive for gold appreciation",
      "High volatility regime with mean-reverting properties supports consolidation",
      "Previous MACD bearish crossover and negative accumulation indicate momentum pause"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Unable to analyze current market conditions due to technical data retrieval errors. Based on the established consolidation pattern from December 30-31, where gold successfully defended E21 support at 4318.42 despite intraday volatility, the regime is likely continuing its consolidation phase. The high volatility environment with mean-reverting properties and supportive cross-asset signals (DXY weakness, low VIX) suggest this is a healthy pause rather than trend reversal. The asset maintained above-cloud positioning and key supports in recent sessions, indicating constructive digestion of the explosive breakout rally from earlier in December.",

      "Potential for deeper pullback toward E50 support at 4187 if consolidation extends",
