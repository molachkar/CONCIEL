    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4338.03 after trading between 4322.97-4404.0, maintaining position above key EMAs (E21:4318.54, E50:4182.27) but below E9 (4383.81), showing consolidation after recent breakout with price inside Bollinger Bands (BBM:4311.71)",
    "momentum": "RSI neutral at 54.81, MACD bearish crossover (75.0 < SIG:76.06, HIST:-1.06), ADX at 33.65 showing moderate trend strength with +DI > -DI (26.13 > 19.93), Stochastic neutral (K:42.5, D:60.16)",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 77.55%, PARK_VOL: 0.012) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.4139), ATR of 84.22 showing wide daily ranges, negative accumulation (-0.0337) suggesting distribution",
    "cross_assets": "DXY showing continued weakness (STRONG_DOWN, BELOW_CLOUD, RSI 40.13) supporting gold, SPX in bullish EMA stack but weak trend (WEAK_TREND, ABOVE_CLOUD), VIX in bearish EMA stack with oversold conditions (CCI_OS, WILL_OS) indicating low fear environment"

    "regime": "CONSOLIDATION",
    "trend": "Bullish trend intact but showing consolidation characteristics - price above key support EMAs (E21, E50) but below short-term E9, inside Bollinger Bands after recent breakout extension",
    "key_drivers": [
      "MACD bearish crossover with negative histogram (-1.06) indicating momentum deceleration",
      "High volatility regime (77.55%) with mean-reverting properties supporting consolidation phase",
      "DXY continued weakness (STRONG_DOWN) providing underlying support for gold",
      "Price holding above critical EMA supports (E21:4318.54, E50:4182.27) maintaining bullish structure",
      "Negative accumulation (-0.0337) suggesting profit-taking after recent explosive rally"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold is entering a consolidation phase after the explosive breakout rally from 4483 to 4549 levels. While the overall bullish trend remains intact with price above key moving averages (E21, E50) and supportive cross-asset signals (DXY weakness, low VIX), technical indicators show clear deceleration. The MACD bearish crossover, neutral RSI, and negative accumulation suggest profit-taking and momentum pause. The high volatility regime with mean-reverting properties (HURST 0.4139) supports a consolidation phase where price may trade in a range while digesting recent gains. The asset maintains its bullish positioning above cloud and key supports, indicating this is likely a healthy pause rather than a reversal.",
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "risk_factors": [
      "MACD bearish crossover with negative histogram suggests further momentum deterioration",
      "High volatility regime (77.55%) may lead to increased price swings and uncertainty",
      "Negative accumulation (-0.0337) indicates institutional selling pressure",
      "Price rejection from 4404 high suggests resistance building in 4400-4425 zone",
      "Potential for deeper pullback toward E21 support at 4318 if consolidation continues"
