    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4332.5, made a high of 4404.0, low of 4322.97 and closed at 4338.03 on moderate volume (391,222). Price sits just above the 20‑day SMA (BBM 4311.71) and well below the upper Bollinger Band (4515.42). PSAR (4549.72) is above price.",
    "momentum": "RSI 54.81 (neutral), MACD 75.0 vs signal 76.06 (histogram -1.06, slight bearish), ADX 33.65 with +DI 26.13 > -DI 19.93 (strong uptrend). Stochastic K 42.5/D 60.16, WILL -57.5, CCI 34.32, MFI 69.49.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT 76.3%, PARK_VOL 0.012). Hurst 0.4139 indicates short‑term mean‑reversion. Efficiency low (0.169).",
    "cross_assets": "S&P500 near flat, RSI 57.45, MACD positive, ADX low (13.34) – weak trend but bullish EMA stack. VIX low, EMA bear stack, ADX 16.17 – low fear environment. DXY weakening (close 97.9, RSI 40.13, ADX 27.26, -DI > +DI) – dollar downtrend supporting gold."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "RISK_ON",
    "trend": "Gold is in a short‑term pull‑back within an overall up‑trend. ADX remains strong, +DI dominates, but MACD histogram has turned slightly negative and price is below the PSAR, suggesting a possible near‑term correction before resuming higher.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Strong ADX (33.65) with +DI > -DI confirming an underlying uptrend",
      "Weakening US dollar (DXY) removing head‑winds for gold",
      "Low VIX indicating risk‑on sentiment across markets",
      "High volatility regime providing room for a directional move"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The combination of a robust ADX trend signal, a down‑trending dollar, and a complacent VIX creates a risk‑on backdrop that favors gold despite the current pull‑back. Price remains above key support levels (20‑day SMA, POC) and the high volatility environment suggests the market is primed for a breakout continuation once the short‑term correction resolves.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "MACD histogram turning negative and PSAR above price hint at a possible near‑term reversal",
      "RSI near neutral (54.8) – loss of bullish momentum could trigger further pull‑back",
      "High volatility may produce rapid price swings or false breakouts",
      "If the dollar rebounds sharply, gold could face renewed downside pressure"
