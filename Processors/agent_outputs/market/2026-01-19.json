    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4667.89 after strong intraday rally (H:4690.27, L:4618.99), above all EMAs and near upper Bollinger Band. SPX flat at 6877.54, VIX elevated at 19.22, DXY stable at 98.83",
    "momentum": "Gold shows strong bullish momentum (RSI:71.18 OB, MACD:96.76 > SIG:85.35, HIST:11.4 positive). SPX neutral (RSI:48.1), VIX bullish (RSI:64.11), DXY neutral (RSI:54.88)",
    "volatility": "Gold in high volatility regime (VOL_PCT:85.24%, PARK_VOL:0.013), SPX/VIX/DXY in low volatility regimes. Gold ATR:81.92 indicates high daily ranges",

    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish trend for Gold with momentum confirmation, risk-off environment supporting safe-haven flows",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Gold technical breakout above all EMAs",
      "Strong momentum indicators (RSI OB, MACD bullish)",
      "High volatility regime supporting directional moves",
      "Risk-off sentiment (VIX elevated)"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates clear breakout characteristics: price above all moving averages (E9:4574.9, E21:4483.51, E50:4323.98, E200:3774.8), strong bullish momentum signals (EMA_BULL_STACK, RSI_OB, STRONG_UP), and high volatility regime. The move occurs despite stable DXY, suggesting gold-specific bullish factors rather than dollar weakness. Elevated VIX supports risk-off environment favorable for gold.",
