    "momentum": "RSI bullish at 68.74 (approaching overbought), MACD strongly bullish (84.15 > 73.51) with positive histogram (10.63), ADX at 28.93 showing developing trend strength with +DI > -DI (31.94 > 13.76), Stochastic overbought (K:86.51, D:87.64)",

    "cross_assets": "DXY showing breakout strength (BB_BREAKOUT_UP, ABOVE_CLOUD, CCI_OB) closing at 98.94, SPX in bullish EMA stack but weak trend (WEAK_TREND, ABOVE_CLOUD), VIX in low volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 3.95%) with bearish signals"

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish momentum with clear breakout continuation - price above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, closing well above key supports despite intraday pullback from 4634 high, maintaining above-cloud positioning with strengthening trend indicators",
    "key_drivers": [
      "EMA_BULL_STACK signal with price above all key EMAs confirming robust bullish structure",
      "MACD strongly bullish with positive histogram (10.63) confirming momentum acceleration",
      "High volatility regime (84.62%) supporting momentum continuation with mean-reverting properties",
      "Positive accumulation (0.5425) indicating sustained institutional buying pressure",
      "New high at 4634.28 breaking above previous resistance levels",
      "STRONG_UP signal and ABOVE_CLOUD positioning maintaining bullish technical configuration"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates powerful breakout continuation with today's action showing new highs at 4634.28 and strong technical momentum. The MACD maintains strong bullish configuration with positive histogram (10.63), while positive accumulation (0.5425) indicates institutional participation remains robust. Price maintains position above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal and closed strongly despite testing lower levels intraday. The high volatility regime (84.62%) combined with mean-reverting properties supports continued momentum. While DXY shows breakout strength which could provide headwinds, SPX maintains bullish structure and VIX remains low, indicating sustained risk-on sentiment. Technical indicators show strong momentum with RSI approaching overbought but not yet extreme, suggesting the breakout has further room to run.",
    "confidence": 0.87,
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI approaching overbought at 68.74 may suggest near-term pullback risk",
      "Stochastic deeply overbought (K:86.51, D:87.64) indicating potential exhaustion",
      "DXY showing BB_BREAKOUT_UP and CCI_OB could signal dollar strength that may pressure gold",
      "High volatility regime (84.62%) may lead to sharp reversals or increased price swings",
      "Intraday range from 4634.28 high to 4569.19 low shows significant volatility and profit-taking",
      "Consolidation probability at 0.5 suggests potential for pause within the broader breakout"
