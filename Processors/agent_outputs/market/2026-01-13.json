    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4602.3, made a high of 4634.28, low of 4569.19 and closed at 4585.65. Price remains well above all major EMAs (E9 4496.17, E21 4416.72, E50 4271.47) and above the 20‑day Bollinger middle (4421.76). PSAR sits far below price (4292.72), confirming bullish pressure.",
    "momentum": "RSI 68.74 (bullish/overbought), MACD line 84.15 above signal 73.51 with a strong positive histogram 10.63, ADX 28.93 with +DI 31.94 > -DI 13.76 indicating a solid uptrend. Stochastic K/D ~86/88, WILLR -13.49, CCI 155.77.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT 83.58%), mean‑reverting Hurst 0.3569, efficiency 0.3329, accumulation positive 0.5425.",
    "cross_assets": "Dollar index (DXY) weak/neutral but still above cloud (98.94), S&P500 bullish (EMA_BULL_STACK) though trend weak (ADX 12.19), VIX low and bearish (CLOSE 16.53, ADX 15.19, -DI > +DI). Overall macro backdrop remains risk‑on."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is in a bullish breakout phase, maintaining price above all key moving averages and the 20‑day Bollinger middle while showing strong momentum and a robust ADX‑driven uptrend.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Price remains above major EMAs and well within the upper Bollinger range, indicating continuation of the uptrend.",
      "Strong momentum: RSI 68.74, MACD bullish cross with large positive histogram, ADX > 25 with +DI dominance.",
      "High volatility regime provides room for rapid moves while efficiency and accumulation stay positive.",
      "Supportive cross‑asset environment: weak dollar, bullish equity market, low VIX reinforcing risk‑on sentiment."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The combination of a decisive price level above key technical thresholds, bullish momentum indicators, and a macro backdrop that favors risk assets aligns with a breakout regime. Despite a modest pull‑back from the previous session high, the price still sits above all major support levels and the PSAR is far below, confirming sustained buying pressure. High volatility is channelled into directional movement, as evidenced by positive accumulation and efficiency metrics.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "Price is approaching the upper Bollinger Band (BBU 4611.79) which may act as near‑term resistance.",
      "RSI is in overbought territory, raising the risk of a short‑term pull‑back.",
      "High volatility (83% of typical volume) could produce sharp reversals or false breakouts.",
      "A sudden rebound in the dollar index could erode gold's upside momentum."
