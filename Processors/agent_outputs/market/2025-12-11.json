    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish trend acceleration with renewed momentum, maintaining above all EMAs, bullish Ichimoku cloud positioning, and strengthening momentum indicators after consolidation period",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200)",
      "Above cloud positioning with strong Ichimoku signals and positive accumulation (0.6701)",
      "RSI improvement to 67.34 showing strong bullish momentum with room for further upside",

      "DXY weakness closing at 98.31 with oversold conditions and BB breakout down reducing downward pressure"

    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates strong breakout acceleration after recent consolidation, closing at 4279.4 with significant intraday range and strong momentum. Price remains well above all major moving averages with strengthening momentum indicators (RSI 67.34, MACD positive histogram 3.45). The successful defense of the 4203 level and close near session highs shows underlying strength. High volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. Cross-asset signals remain highly favorable with VIX at new lows (15.97) with extreme oversold conditions and DXY showing continued weakness with BB breakout down and oversold readings, creating optimal conditions for gold appreciation. The acceleration aligns with the broader breakout structure observed in previous days.",

    "risk_factors": [
      "Stochastic showing extreme overbought signals (K:97.43, D:86.21)",
      "High volatility regime may indicate increased price swings",
      "Price approaching upper Bollinger Band resistance at 4294.81",
      "VIX at extreme oversold levels may be due for mean reversion",
      "MFI at 77.74 showing potential overbought conditions"
