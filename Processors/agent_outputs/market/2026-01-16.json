    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4614.1, reached a high of 4620.45, a low of 4536.52 and closed at 4595.52. The close stays above all major EMAs (E9 4551.65, E21 4465.07, E50 4309.95) and above the 20‑day Bollinger middle (BBM 4466.47) while still below the upper Bollinger band (BBU 4673.45). PSAR (4363.82) is well below price, confirming bullish pressure.",
    "momentum": "RSI 66.93 (bullish), MACD line 92.39 above signal 82.5 with a positive histogram of 9.89, ADX 30.17 with +DI 27.49 > -DI 15.95 indicating a strong uptrend.",
    "volatility": "Volatility regime is high (VOL_PCT 83.99%) with a mean‑reverting Hurst exponent 0.3509. Accumulation is positive (0.6045) and efficiency moderate (0.2906), suggesting volatility is being channeled into directional moves.",
    "cross_assets": "Dollar index (DXY) is weak/neutral (price 99.17, RSI 62.56, overbought signals) supporting gold. S&P500 is bullish but shows a weak trend (ADX 10.95, MACD bearish cross) and low momentum. VIX remains low and bearish (C 16.33, ADX 13.25) indicating low market fear. Overall macro backdrop is risk‑on."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold continues a clear breakout above the recent 4500‑4600 consolidation range, maintaining price above all key moving averages and the 20‑day Bollinger middle while exhibiting strong bullish momentum.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Close at 4595.52 above all major EMAs and well above the 20‑day Bollinger middle.",
      "Bullish momentum: RSI 66.9, MACD bullish cross with a sizable positive histogram, ADX > 30 with +DI dominance.",
      "High accumulation (0.6045) and efficiency indicating volatility is being directed into upward price movement.",
      "Supportive cross‑asset environment: weak dollar, bullish equity market despite weak trend, and low VIX reflecting limited fear.",
      "PSAR below price confirming sustained buying pressure."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The price action shows a decisive advance that stays above critical technical thresholds (EMAs, Bollinger middle, PSAR). Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, ADX) are all bullish, and the high‑volatility regime is accompanied by strong accumulation, meaning the market is converting volatility into directional strength. Cross‑asset signals further reinforce the breakout: a softening dollar and a risk‑on backdrop from equities and low VIX support continued gold buying. Together these factors point to a breakout regime rather than consolidation or breakdown.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "High volatility (≈84% of typical volume) could trigger sharp pull‑backs or false breakouts.",
      "Price is approaching the upper Bollinger band (4673.45) and may encounter near‑term resistance.",
      "RSI is approaching overbought territory, raising the risk of a short‑term correction.",
      "A sudden rebound in the dollar index could erode gold's supportive edge."
