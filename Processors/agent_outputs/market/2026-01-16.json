    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4595.52 (down from open 4614.1) after trading between 4536.52-4620.45, maintaining position above all key EMAs (E9:4551.65, E21:4465.07, E50:4309.95, E200:3765.82) with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, STRONG_UP designation, and ABOVE_CLOUD positioning, showing healthy pullback within ongoing breakout",
    "momentum": "RSI bullish at 66.93, MACD strongly bullish (92.39 > 82.5) with positive histogram (9.89), ADX at 30.17 showing strong trend strength with +DI > -DI (27.49 > 15.95), Stochastic overbought (K:87.21, D:91.72), CCI overbought at 100.92",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 85.03%, PARK_VOL: 0.013) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3509), ATR of 80.94 showing wide daily ranges, strong positive accumulation (0.6045) indicating sustained institutional buying support",

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish momentum continues despite healthy pullback - price maintains position above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, strong trend indicators, and supportive technical structure within the broader breakout",
    "key_drivers": [
      "EMA_BULL_STACK signal with price well above all key EMAs confirming robust bullish structure",
      "MACD strongly bullish with positive histogram (9.89) maintaining momentum acceleration",
      "High volatility regime (85.03%) supporting continued momentum with mean-reverting properties",
      "Strong positive accumulation (0.6045) indicating sustained institutional buying pressure",
      "ADX at 30.17 shows strong trend strength with clear directional dominance (+DI > -DI)",
      "Supportive cross-asset environment with SPX bullish and VIX low volatility despite DXY strength"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold maintains its breakout regime despite today's healthy pullback from 4620.45 high. The technical structure remains robust with price above all moving averages (EMA_BULL_STACK), strong momentum indicators (MACD bullish with positive histogram, ADX showing strong trend strength), and high volatility regime supporting continued momentum. While RSI (66.93) and Stochastic (K:87.21) show overbought conditions, these are typical in strong breakouts and don't indicate reversal. The strong accumulation (0.6045) confirms institutional participation remains robust. Cross-asset analysis shows mixed signals with DXY strength potentially providing headwinds, but SPX maintains bullish structure and VIX remains in low volatility regime, indicating sustained risk-on sentiment. The pullback appears healthy within the broader breakout context, testing but holding above key support levels.",
    "confidence": 0.86,
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI at 66.93 and Stochastic overbought (K:87.21) suggest near-term pullback risk",
      "DXY showing strong bullish signals (ABOVE_CLOUD, MFI_OB, CCI_OB) could pressure gold if dollar strength continues",
      "High volatility regime (85.03%) may lead to sharp reversals or increased price swings",
      "CCI overbought at 100.92 indicates potential momentum moderation",
      "Intraday range from 4620.45 high to 4536.52 low shows continued volatility and profit-taking",
      "Consolidation probability at 0.5 suggests potential for pause within the broader breakout trend"
