  "analysis": {
    "regime": "RISK_ON",
    "trend": "Gold is in a strong uptrend, supported by bullish technicals and high volatility. S&P500 is consolidating with a slight bullish bias. VIX and DXY are not providing strong counter signals.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Gold's bullish EMA stacking and high volatility",
      "S&P500's neutral but slightly bullish stance",
      "VIX's subdued levels despite minor uptick",
      "DXY's low volatility and lack of directional bias"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The combination of Gold's strong uptrend, S&P500's stability, and low fear (VIX) suggests a RISK_ON environment. DXY's inactivity removes a potential headwind for risk assets.",

      "Gold's overbought conditions (CCI_OB, WILL_OB)",
      "Potential mean-reversion in high volatility regimes",
