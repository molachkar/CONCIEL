    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4331.48 after significant intraday range (4300.7-4549.3), below opening but above key EMA supports. Large daily range suggests high volatility activity.",
    "momentum": "Mixed signals - RSI neutral (54.27), MACD positive but histogram declining (7.75), ADX shows moderate trend strength (35.21) with +DI > -DI indicating bullish bias.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 76.72%, PARK_VOL: 0.0119), mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.4233), wide Bollinger Bands (width: 9.58).",
    "cross_assets": "DXY strongly bearish (STRONG_DOWN, below cloud), SPX bullish but overbought (CCI_OB, WILL_OB), VIX low and bearish - typical risk-on environment supporting gold."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Bullish with consolidation characteristics - price above key EMAs (E21:4316.59, E50:4175.92), strong volume, but testing resistance levels.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Dollar weakness (DXY STRONG_DOWN)",
      "Risk-on sentiment (SPX bullish, VIX low)",
      "High volatility supporting momentum moves",
      "MACD bullish crossover despite histogram decline"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold shows strong upward momentum with high volatility and volume. The asset closed near session lows but maintains position above critical moving averages. Cross-asset analysis reveals dollar weakness and risk-on environment typically supportive for gold. The combination of technical strength (STRONG_UP signal, in cloud) and favorable macro conditions suggests breakout potential despite some profit-taking at highs.",

    "risk_factors": [
      "Large intraday reversal from highs (4549 to 4331)",
      "Overbought conditions in correlated assets (SPX)",
