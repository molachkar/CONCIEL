    "price_action": "Gold opened near 4538, fell to a low of 4300 and closed at 4331, trading just above the 20‑day Bollinger middle band (4306) and well within the day's range. The price sits above the POC (4189) but below the VAH (4631), indicating a pull‑back within a broader up‑trend.",
    "momentum": "RSI 54 (neutral), MACD (+84) above signal (+76) with a positive histogram (+7.8) – bullish. ADX 35 (strong trend) with +DI (28) > -DI (21) – bullish. Stochastic K 42/D 75 shows bearish divergence, PSAR sits above price (bearish). Overall momentum leans bullish but mixed.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT 75.5%, PARK_VOL 0.0119). Hurst 0.42 suggests mean‑reverting behavior in the short term. Efficiency low (0.158) and spread estimate 0.0172 indicate price is moving in a wide range.",
    "cross_assets": "S&P500 modestly higher (close 6906, RSI 58, weak ADX 13). VIX low at 16.5 with bearish MACD and low ADX – risk sentiment low. DXY weakening (close 97.68, RSI 34, -DI > +DI) – dollar under pressure. Combined picture: weakening dollar, low VIX, modest equity strength – a risk‑on backdrop."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "RISK_ON",
    "trend": "Gold is in a short‑term pull‑back within an overall up‑trend; momentum indicators are mildly bullish while price action shows consolidation under high volatility.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Strong ADX and positive MACD histogram for gold",
      "High volatility regime increasing breakout potential",
      "Weakening US dollar (DXY) supporting precious metals",
      "Low VIX indicating reduced fear and higher risk appetite"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold's price has retreated from its recent high but remains above key support levels (POC, 20‑day SMA) and exhibits bullish momentum (MACD, ADX). The high volatility regime suggests the market is primed for a directional move. Concurrently, the dollar is in a downtrend and the VIX is at multi‑year lows, both of which typically favor risk assets like gold and equities. Hence the dominant market environment is risk‑on, with gold likely to break higher if it clears the recent high of 4549.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "Potential reversal if price breaks below the 20‑day SMA (~4306) and the PSAR remains above price",
      "Unexpected dollar strength could cap gold upside",
      "Elevated volatility could trigger rapid price swings and false breakouts"
