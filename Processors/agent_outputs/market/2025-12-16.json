    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish trend continuation with price above all moving averages and Ichimoku cloud, supported by extreme dollar weakness and positive momentum indicators despite some consolidation near highs",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200)",
      "Above cloud positioning with strong Ichimoku signals and positive accumulation (0.2519)",
      "DXY extreme weakness with RSI 29.38 and bearish EMA stack supporting gold appreciation",

    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates breakout continuation despite some intraday consolidation, closing at 4301.05 while maintaining position above all major moving averages. The technical structure remains strongly bullish with RSI at 68.78 (strong but not extreme), MACD positive, and ADX showing trend strength. Cross-asset signals remain highly favorable with DXY showing extreme weakness (RSI 29.38, bearish EMA stack) which historically supports gold appreciation. The medium volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. While price showed some consolidation near the 4335 resistance, the overall breakout structure remains intact with strong underlying support levels.",
