    "price_action": "Gold (XAUUSD) closed at 4925.97, up from open 4833.02, with session range 4772.19-4928.3 showing strong bullish momentum and close near session highs. Price above all EMAs (E9:4710.27, E21:4573.51, E50:4382.61, E200:3806.34) and breaking above Bollinger Band upper (4870.06).",
    "momentum": "Extremely strong bullish momentum: RSI overbought (81.19), MACD strongly bullish (134.28 vs SIG 103.2, HIST +31.08), ADX strong trend strength (35.08), +DI (39.26) significantly exceeds -DI (10.42). Signals: EMA_BULL_STACK, RSI_OB, STRONG_UP, BB_BREAKOUT_UP, ABOVE_CLOUD, CCI_OB, WILL_OB.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 88.15%, ATR: 92.13) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3584). Strong positive accumulation (0.4462) indicates robust underlying buying pressure. Efficiency moderate (0.4408) supporting directional movement.",
    "cross_assets": "S&P500 neutral (EMA_BULL_STACK, WEAK_TREND, ABOVE_CLOUD). VIX neutral (IN_CLOUD, TK_BULL_X). DXY bearish (EMA_BEAR_STACK, BB_BREAKOUT_DN, BELOW_CLOUD, CCI_OS, WILL_OS). Overall cross-asset signals mixed with DXY weakness potentially supportive for gold."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold demonstrates explosive breakout momentum with strong close near session highs, maintaining position above all key moving averages and decisively breaking above Bollinger Band upper limit. The breakout from previous consolidation phase continues with decisive move above 4800 resistance level.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Strong bullish close at 4925.97 near session high (4928.3) with significant advance from open (4833.02)",
      "EMA bull stack with price above all key moving averages confirming robust bullish structure",
      "Extremely strong momentum signals with RSI overbought, MACD strongly bullish with large positive histogram, and dominant +DI",
      "High volatility regime (88.15%) with positive accumulation (0.4462) indicating institutional buying pressure",
      "DXY weakness (bearish signals) providing tailwind for gold's bullish momentum"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold exhibits clear breakout continuation characteristics with price advancing decisively above previous resistance levels and breaking Bollinger Band upper limit. Technical indicators show extremely strong bullish momentum with RSI in overbought territory, MACD showing strong bullish divergence with large positive histogram, and powerful directional movement indicators. The high volatility regime supports continued upward movement while positive accumulation confirms underlying buying pressure. Cross-asset signals are mixed but DXY weakness provides supportive environment for gold's bullish momentum.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "High volatility regime (88.15%) increases position risk and potential for sharp reversals",
      "RSI extremely overbought (81.19) and multiple overbought signals (CCI_OB, WILL_OB) suggest heightened risk of near-term pullback",
      "Mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3584) suggests potential for consolidation after strong advance",
      "S&P500 showing neutral signals could eventually weigh on risk sentiment"
