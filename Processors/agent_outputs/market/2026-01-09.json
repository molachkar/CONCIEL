    "price_action": "Gold closed strong at 4509.02 (up from open 4478.9) after trading between 4452.59-4516.9, maintaining position above all key EMAs (E9:4442.62, E21:4379.95, E50:4244.77, E200:3722.84) with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, STRONG_UP designation, and ABOVE_CLOUD positioning, showing breakout continuation with new highs near 4520 level",
    "momentum": "RSI bullish at 65.2, MACD bullish with positive histogram (2.25) and MACD above signal line (70.96 > 68.71), ADX at 27.24 showing developing trend strength with +DI > -DI (26.74 > 16.17), Stochastic overbought (K:85.25, D:75.0)",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 84.82%, PARK_VOL: 0.013) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3659), ATR of 83.89 showing wide daily ranges, extremely positive accumulation (0.7993) indicating very strong institutional buying",
    "cross_assets": "DXY showing breakout signals (BB_BREAKOUT_UP, ABOVE_CLOUD, CCI_OB) with bullish momentum, SPX in bullish EMA stack but weak trend (WEAK_TREND, ABOVE_CLOUD, CCI_OB), VIX in bearish EMA stack with oversold conditions (MFI_OS, WILL_OS) indicating low fear environment"

    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish momentum with clear breakout continuation - price above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, closing near session highs, and maintaining above-cloud positioning with strengthening trend indicators and new highs",
    "key_drivers": [
      "MACD bullish with positive histogram (2.25) confirming momentum acceleration",
      "Extremely high positive accumulation (0.7993) indicating very strong institutional buying pressure",
      "EMA_BULL_STACK signal with price above all key EMAs confirming robust bullish structure",
      "New high at 4516.9 breaking above previous resistance levels",
      "Supportive cross-asset environment with SPX bullish, VIX oversold, and risk-on sentiment",
      "High volatility regime (84.82%) supporting momentum continuation with mean-reverting properties"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates powerful breakout continuation with today's action showing new highs at 4516.9 and strong technical improvements. The MACD maintains bullish configuration with positive histogram (2.25), while extremely high accumulation (0.7993) indicates robust institutional participation. Price maintains position above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal and closed strongly despite testing lower levels intraday. The high volatility regime (84.82%) combined with mean-reverting properties supports continued momentum. Cross-asset analysis reveals a mixed but generally favorable environment with SPX maintaining bullish structure, VIX deeply oversold indicating low fear, though DXY shows breakout strength which could provide headwinds. Technical indicators show strong momentum with room for further upside despite overbought Stochastic conditions.",
    "confidence": 0.89,
    "risk_factors": [
      "DXY showing BB_BREAKOUT_UP and CCI_OB could signal dollar strength that may pressure gold",
      "Stochastic deeply overbought (K:85.25) indicating potential near-term exhaustion",
      "High volatility regime (84.82%) may lead to sharp reversals or increased price swings",
      "PSAR resistance at 4273.81 provides distant but psychological hurdle",
      "Consolidation probability at 0.5 suggests potential for pause within the broader breakout",
      "VIX oversold conditions (MFI_OS, WILL_OS) may indicate complacency that could reverse"
