    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4448.35, up significantly from open (4360.81) with session range 4344.43-4455.43, breaking above recent consolidation resistance and closing near session highs. Price above all EMAs (E9:4379.83, E21:4331.32, E50:4203.22, E200:3691.82) and approaching Bollinger Band upper (4526.01).",
    "momentum": "Strong bullish momentum: RSI bullish (63.06), MACD improving (61.29 vs SIG 68.88, HIST -7.59 narrowing), ADX moderate trend strength (28.96), +DI (26.4) significantly exceeds -DI (18.61). Signals: EMA_BULL_STACK, STRONG_UP, ABOVE_CLOUD.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 81.7%, ATR: 88.51) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3843). Positive accumulation (0.0741) suggests underlying buying pressure. Efficiency improved (0.3212) indicating directional movement.",
    "cross_assets": "DXY weak (BELOW_CLOUD) supporting gold. S&P500 bullish (EMA_BULL_STACK, ABOVE_CLOUD, WILL_OB) with weak trend. VIX bearish (EMA_BEAR_STACK, BELOW_CLOUD, WILL_OS) indicating low fear environment. Overall cross-asset signals strongly supportive for gold breakout."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold breaks out of consolidation phase with strong bullish momentum, closing near session highs above all key moving averages and approaching Bollinger Band upper limit. Underlying bullish structure confirmed with improved momentum signals.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Breakout above recent consolidation resistance (4400-4450 range) with strong close at 4448.35",
      "Significant price advance from open (4360.81) to close (4448.35) showing sustained buying pressure",
      "EMA bull stack with price above all key moving averages confirming bullish structure",
      "Improving momentum signals with RSI bullish, MACD histogram narrowing, and strong +DI dominance",
      "Supportive cross-asset environment with DXY weakness, S&P500 bullish, and low VIX"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates clear breakout characteristics with price breaking above recent consolidation resistance, strong intraday momentum, and closing near session highs. Technical indicators show improving bullish momentum with RSI in bullish territory, MACD histogram narrowing, and strong directional movement indicators. The high volatility regime supports continued movement while positive accumulation suggests underlying buying pressure. Cross-asset signals remain strongly supportive with dollar weakness and risk-on environment.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "High volatility regime (81.7%) increases position risk and potential for sharp reversals",
      "Approaching Bollinger Band upper limit (4526.01) may act as near-term resistance",
      "Mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3843) suggests potential for pullback after strong move",
      "Overbought conditions in correlated S&P500 (WILL_OB) may limit further risk-on support",
      "Breakout requires confirmation with follow-through above 4455.43 high"
