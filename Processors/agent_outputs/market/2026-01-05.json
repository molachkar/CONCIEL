    "price_action": "Gold closed strong at 4448.35 (up from open 4360.81), near daily high 4455.43, above all EMAs with bullish EMA stack signal",
    "momentum": "RSI 63.06 (bullish but not overbought), MACD positive 61.29 but below signal line, ADX 28.96 shows developing trend strength",

    "trend": "Strong bullish momentum with high volatility breakout characteristics",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Strong gold price action above all EMAs",
      "High volatility regime supporting momentum moves",
      "Risk-on environment with SPX bullish and VIX suppressed",
      "Dollar weakness providing tailwind for gold"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold shows strong bullish price action closing near highs, above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal. High volatility regime (82.95%) combined with mean-reverting state suggests momentum continuation. Cross-asset signals support risk-on environment with SPX bullish and VIX oversold, while DXY weakness typically benefits gold. Technical indicators show room for further upside without overbought conditions.",
