    "price_action": "Gold (XAUUSD) showing strong bullish breakout - closed at 4532.36 (up from open 4490.01), breaking above Bollinger Band upper (4509.76) with high volume (390k). SPX flat with weak trend, VIX low/stable, DXY in strong downtrend.",
    "momentum": "Gold RSI 82.16 (overbought), MACD bullish (95.1 > SIG 74.38), ADX 36.88 (strong trend). SPX momentum mixed (RSI 61.6, weak ADX 13.66). DXY momentum bearish (RSI 35.15, ADX 27.08).",
    "volatility": "Gold VOL_REGIME: medium (PARK_VOL 0.0095, VOL_PCT 53.64), SPX/VOL/DXY all low volatility regimes. Gold ATR 71.84 indicates elevated but not extreme volatility.",
    "cross_assets": "DXY strong bearish (STRONG_DOWN signal) supportive for gold. SPX flat/weak (WEAK_TREND). VIX low (16.73) indicating complacency, typical in RISK_ON environments but not extreme."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish trend for gold with confirmation from momentum, price action, and weak DXY. Other assets in consolidation/weak trends.",

      "Gold breaking above BBU with high volume",
      "DXY strong downtrend (bearish)",
      "Gold RSI/MACD/ADX all showing strong bullish momentum",

    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold exhibits clear breakout characteristics: price above BBU, strong bullish EMA stack, high RSI/MACD, and confirmation from weak DXY (inverse relationship). Volatility is medium but not excessive, and volume supports the move. Other assets are not in extreme states, making gold the primary breakout story.",
