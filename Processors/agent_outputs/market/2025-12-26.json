    "price_action": "Gold (XAUUSD) showing strong bullish breakout - closed at 4532.36 (up from open 4490.01), breaking above Bollinger Band upper (4509.76) with high volume (390k). SPX flat near highs (6929.65), DXY weak (97.71), VIX low (16.73) indicating calm markets.",
    "momentum": "Gold RSI extremely overbought (82.16), MACD bullish (95.1 > SIG 74.38), ADX strong trend (36.88). SPX momentum neutral (RSI 61.6), DXY oversold (RSI 35.15), VIX weak momentum.",
    "volatility": "Gold in medium volatility regime (VOL_PCT 53.64%, PARK_VOL 0.0095), SPX low volatility (16.01%), DXY very low volatility (3.12%), VIX low volatility (21.0%).",
    "cross_assets": "Negative DXY-Gold correlation evident (DXY weak at 97.71 supports gold strength). Low VIX (16.73) and stable SPX support risk-on environment. Gold breaking out while dollar breaks down."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish trend for gold with confirmed breakout above technical resistance levels",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Gold breaking above Bollinger Bands with high volume",
      "Dollar weakness (DXY breaking down)",
      "Low volatility environment supporting risk assets",
      "Strong momentum indicators (RSI OB, MACD bullish)"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates a clear technical breakout above Bollinger Band upper with strong volume confirmation. The move is supported by dollar weakness (DXY in strong downtrend) and low volatility environment (VIX at 16.73). Momentum indicators are overwhelmingly bullish with RSI severely overbought but trend strength (ADX 36.88) suggests continuation potential. Cross-asset signals align with risk-on conditions.",
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "risk_factors": [
      "Extreme RSI overbought condition may lead to short-term pullback",
      "High gold volatility regime requires careful position sizing",
      "Potential mean reversion given HURST 0.422 (mean-reverting state)",
      "Dependence on continued dollar weakness for trend sustainability"
