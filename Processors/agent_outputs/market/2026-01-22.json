    "price_action": "Unable to retrieve due to data file errors. Based on recent context, gold was in strong breakout regime with price above all EMAs, breaking above upper Bollinger Band, and achieving new highs near 4766 on 2026-01-20",
    "momentum": "Unable to retrieve current data. Previous momentum showed RSI extremely overbought (75.49), MACD strongly bullish with positive histogram (16.85), ADX strong trend strength (31.62), Stochastic extremely overbought",
    "volatility": "Unable to retrieve current data. Previous regime showed high volatility (86.9%) with mean-reverting properties and strong positive accumulation (0.6539)",

    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish continuation expected based on recent powerful breakout pattern, though data unavailability prevents precise current assessment",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Recent EMA_BULL_STACK signal with price well above all key EMAs",
      "Previous BB_BREAKOUT_UP signal with price breaking above upper Bollinger Band",
      "High volatility regime supporting momentum continuation",
      "Strong positive accumulation indicating institutional buying pressure",
      "Risk-off environment with SPX weakness and VIX breakout supporting safe-haven flows"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Despite current data unavailability, the strong breakout pattern established in recent days (new highs above 4760, breaking above Bollinger Bands, EMA_BULL_STACK configuration) combined with supportive risk-off cross-asset environment (SPX weakness, VIX elevated, DXY weak) suggests continuation of the BREAKOUT regime. The high volatility regime and strong institutional accumulation support momentum persistence, though overbought conditions noted in previous data warrant monitoring for potential pullback risks.",

    "risk_factors": [
      "Data unavailability prevents real-time assessment of current conditions",
      "Previous extremely overbought conditions (RSI 75.49, Stochastic extreme) suggest elevated pullback risk",
      "High volatility regime may lead to sharp reversals",
      "VIX breakout indicates significant market stress that could affect all assets",
      "Potential mean reversion after breaking above upper Bollinger Band"
