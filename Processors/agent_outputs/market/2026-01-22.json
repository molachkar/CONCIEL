    "price_action": "Open 4833.02, high 4928.3, low 4772.19, close 4925.97. Close is well above all major EMAs (E9 4710.27, E21 4573.51, E50 4382.61, E200 3806.34) and above the upper Bollinger band (BBU 4870.06). PSAR at 4518.64 sits far below price. Volume 301,672 (high).",
    "momentum": "RSI 81.19 (deep overbought), MACD line 134.28 above signal 103.2 with a large positive histogram 31.08, ADX 35.08 with +DI 39.26 > -DI 10.42 indicating a strong uptrend. Stochastic K/D 99.6/96.4 (overbought). WILLR -0.4 (near neutral), CCI 183.61 (overbought).",
    "volatility": "Volatility regime high (VOL_PCT 87.32%). Hurst exponent 0.3503 → mean‑reverting state despite strong move. Accumulation 0.655, efficiency 0.4228, indicating volatility is being channeled into directional buying pressure.",
    "cross_assets": "Dollar index (DXY) weak/neutral, trading below its cloud, weak trend (ADX 19.0, -DI > +DI). Supports gold. S&P500 in a weak downtrend (ADX 12.46, -DI > +DI), low momentum, limiting upside pressure on gold. VIX low, weak upward breakout, still below cloud, indicating low overall market fear."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is executing a strong bullish breakout, trading well above all key moving averages, the 20‑day Bollinger middle, and now above the upper Bollinger band. Momentum indicators are overwhelmingly bullish and the high‑volatility environment is accompanied by strong positive accumulation, confirming directional buying pressure.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Close 4925.97 above all major EMAs and above the upper Bollinger band.",
      "PSAR far below price, confirming sustained bullish pressure.",
      "MACD bullish crossover with a large positive histogram (+31.08).",
      "ADX 35.08 with +DI dominance, confirming a robust uptrend.",
      "High volume (301k) and high‑volatility regime (87% of typical volume) with strong accumulation (0.655).",
      "Weak dollar (DXY) removing a headwind for gold.",
      "Risk‑on macro backdrop: equities in weak downtrend and VIX low, keeping capital in safe‑haven assets."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The price action decisively breaks above the upper Bollinger band while staying above all trend‑line supports (EMAs, VWAP, PSAR). MACD, ADX, and +DI all signal strong upward momentum, and the high‑volatility regime is efficiently converted into buying pressure as shown by the high accumulation and efficiency scores. Cross‑asset signals reinforce the bullish bias: a softening dollar and a risk‑on environment (weak equity market, low VIX) support further gold buying. These combined factors point to a clear breakout regime.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI and CCI are deep in overbought territory, raising the risk of a short‑term pull‑back or profit‑taking.",
      "Price is near the recent intraday high and just above the upper Bollinger band, which may act as near‑term resistance.",
      "High volatility (87% of typical volume) could produce sharp reversals or false breakouts.",
      "A sudden rebound in the dollar index or unexpected equity strength could erode gold's upside momentum."
