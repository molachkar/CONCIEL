    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4338.67 after trading between 4308.72-4356.36, maintaining position above all key EMAs (E9:4295.2, E21:4235.1, E50:4114.71, E200:3624.09) with bullish stack configuration and above cloud positioning, showing breakout continuation with strong intraday range",
    "momentum": "RSI at 71.23 (strong bullish zone approaching overbought), MACD positive with histogram at 6.93 showing continued bullish momentum, ADX at 28.57 indicating strengthening trend with +DI > -DI (26.85 > 10.76), Stochastic overbought (K:83.06, D:84.78)",
    "volatility": "Medium volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 43.87%) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.4393), ATR of 68.41 showing moderate daily ranges, maintaining breakout environment characteristics with positive accumulation (0.3805)",

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish trend continuation with accelerating momentum, maintaining above all EMAs, bullish Ichimoku cloud positioning, and strengthening momentum indicators with new highs near 4356",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200) with expanding spreads",
      "Above cloud positioning with strong Ichimoku signals and positive accumulation (0.3805)",
      "ADX at 28.57 showing strengthening trend with strong directional movement (+DI 26.85)",
      "DXY continued weakness with bearish signals supporting gold appreciation",
      "MACD histogram at 6.93 indicating continued bullish momentum despite minor consolidation"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates strong breakout continuation, closing at 4338.67 while maintaining position above all major moving averages and testing new highs near 4356. The technical structure remains strongly bullish with RSI at 71.23 (approaching overbought but with historical room for extension in breakout regimes), MACD positive with solid histogram, and ADX showing trend strength. Cross-asset signals remain favorable with DXY showing continued weakness (RSI 42.09, below cloud) which historically supports gold appreciation, while S&P500 strength and VIX decline suggest risk-on sentiment. The medium volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. The successful defense of the 4308 support level and close above key technical levels shows underlying strength in the breakout structure.",

      "Price near upper Bollinger Band resistance at 4364.13",
