  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is in a strong uptrend, supported by bullish technicals and medium volatility. S&P500 is consolidating with a slight bullish bias. VIX and DXY are not providing strong counter signals.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Gold's bullish EMA stacking and medium volatility",

    ],
    "reasoning": "The combination of Gold's strong uptrend, S&P500's stability, and low fear (VIX) suggests a BREAKOUT environment. DXY's inactivity removes a potential headwind for risk assets.",
