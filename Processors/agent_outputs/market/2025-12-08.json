    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4189.89, below the high of 4218.76 and above the low of 4176.0, with volume of 259493 indicating active participation.",
    "momentum": "RSI at 58.66 shows neutral to slight bullish momentum, MACD histogram positive at 1.07, ADX at 21.16 indicates weak trend strength.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_REGIME: high, VOL_PCT: 77.13), ATR at 73.31, Bollinger Band width at 5.75% suggests elevated volatility.",
