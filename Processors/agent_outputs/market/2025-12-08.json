    "price_action": "Gold (XAUUSD) closed at 4189.89, above all EMAs (E9:4185.82, E21:4145.25, E50:4036.24, E200:3561.13) with bullish EMA stack, near session high (4218.76) but below POC (4207.71), indicating slight pullback from intraday peak.",
    "momentum": "RSI at 58.66 (neutral-bullish), MACD positive (46.75 > SIG 45.68, HIST 1.07), ADX weak at 21.16, +DI > -DI (25.5 > 16.8) suggesting mild uptrend momentum but not strong directional strength.",
    "volatility": "VOL_REGIME: high (VOL_PCT 77.13), ATR 73.31, BB_WIDTH 5.75%, PARK_VOL 0.0119 vs YZ_VOL 0.1994, indicating elevated volatility with mean-reverting state (HURST 0.4483).",
    "cross_assets": "SPX (USA500) bullish (above EMAs, RSI 57.04, MACD positive) but weak trend (ADX 15.21); VIX low (17.42, below EMAs, RSI 40.96) signaling low fear; DXY neutral (RSI 45.6, in cloud, weak trend) with slight strength (C:99.06). Gold inversely correlated to DXY/VIX, supported by risk-on SPX."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "CONSOLIDATION",
    "trend": "Mildly bullish but lacking strong directional momentum, trading within range (L:4176.0 to H:4218.76) near EMA support.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack and above cloud signal",
      "High volatility regime with mean-reverting characteristics",
      "Supportive risk-on environment (SPX bullish, VIX low)",
      "Neutral DXY reducing downward pressure"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold shows bullish technical structure (above all EMAs, MACD positive) but ADX is weak (21.16) and price closed below POC, indicating consolidation within the day's range. High volatility (VOL_REGIME: high) and mean-reverting state (HURST 0.4483) suggest range-bound action. Cross-assets support stability: SPX is bullish but with weak trend, VIX is low (risk-on), and DXY is neutral. Probability metrics (BULL_P 0.25, BEAR_P 0.25, CONSOL_P 0.5) align with consolidation.",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "risk_factors": [
      "Volatility spike (ATR 73.31) could amplify moves",
      "DXY strengthening above 99.0 may pressure gold",
      "SPX weak trend (ADX 15.21) may not sustain risk-on support",
