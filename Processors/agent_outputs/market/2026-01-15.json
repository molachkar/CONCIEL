    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4629.23, made a high of 4631.65, low of 4580.81 and closed at 4614.82. Close is above all major EMAs (E9 4540.68, E21 4452.03, E50 4298.29) and above VWAP (4451.76). PSAR sits far below price (4339.57) confirming bullish pressure. Volume is high (351,041).",
    "momentum": "RSI 69.47 (bullish/near overbought), MACD line 92.84 above signal 80.03 with a strong positive histogram (+12.81), ADX 30.44 with +DI 29.69 > -DI 13.01 indicating a solid uptrend. Stochastic K/D ~92/91, WILLR -7.56, CCI 131.07 (overbought).",
    "volatility": "Volatility regime is high (VOL_PCT 82.12%). Hurst 0.3518 suggests a mean‑reverting state despite the strong move. Efficiency 0.3466 and accumulation 0.60 show that volatility is being channeled into directional buying pressure.",
    "cross_assets": "Dollar index (DXY) is weak/neutral (above cloud but overbought CCI, WILL), supporting gold. S&P500 is bullish (EMA_BULL_STACK) but shows a weak trend (ADX 11.23). VIX remains low and bearish (EMA_BEAR_STACK, below cloud) indicating low market fear. Overall macro backdrop remains risk‑on."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is in a strong bullish breakout, maintaining price well above all key moving averages, the 20‑day Bollinger middle, and the VWAP while PSAR remains far below price. Momentum indicators are firmly bullish and volume remains elevated.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Close at 4614.82 above all major EMAs and VWAP.",
      "MACD bullish cross with a large positive histogram (+12.81).",
      "RSI 69.5 and Stochastic >90 indicating strong momentum (despite overbought status).",
      "ADX >30 with +DI dominance confirming a solid uptrend.",
      "High volume and positive accumulation (0.60) in a high‑volatility regime.",
      "Weak dollar and bullish equity market provide a supportive risk‑on environment."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The price action shows a decisive advance into the upper Bollinger range, breaking above recent highs and staying above all major trend lines. Momentum metrics (MACD, RSI, ADX) are all bullish, and the high‑volume, high‑accumulation environment indicates strong buying interest. Cross‑asset signals reinforce the picture: a softening DXY and a bullish S&P500 support gold, while a low VIX reflects limited fear. Together these factors point to a breakout regime despite short‑term overbought warnings.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI and CCI are deep in overbought territory, raising the risk of a short‑term pull‑back.",
      "Price is approaching the upper Bollinger Band (BBU 4658.93) and recent intraday highs, which could act as near‑term resistance.",
      "High volatility (82% of typical volume) may produce sharp reversals or false breakouts.",
      "A sudden rebound in the dollar index could erode gold's upside momentum."
