    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4614.82 (down from open 4629.23) after trading between 4580.81-4631.65, maintaining strong position above all key EMAs (E9:4540.68, E21:4452.03, E50:4298.29, E200:3757.48) with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, STRONG_UP designation, and ABOVE_CLOUD positioning, showing minor pullback within ongoing breakout",
    "momentum": "RSI bullish at 69.47 (approaching overbought), MACD strongly bullish (92.84 > 80.03) with positive histogram (12.81), ADX at 30.44 showing strong trend strength with +DI > -DI (29.69 > 13.01), Stochastic extremely overbought (K:92.44, D:91.48), CCI overbought at 131.07",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 83.37%, PARK_VOL: 0.0128) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3518), ATR of 80.71 showing wide daily ranges, strong positive accumulation (0.6) indicating sustained institutional buying support",

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish momentum continues despite minor pullback - price maintains position above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, strong trend indicators, and supportive technical structure within the broader breakout",
    "key_drivers": [
      "EMA_BULL_STACK signal with price well above all key EMAs confirming robust bullish structure",
      "MACD strongly bullish with positive histogram (12.81) maintaining momentum acceleration",
      "High volatility regime (83.37%) supporting continued momentum with mean-reverting properties",
      "Strong positive accumulation (0.6) indicating sustained institutional buying pressure",
      "ADX at 30.44 shows strong trend strength with clear directional dominance (+DI > -DI)",
      "Supportive cross-asset environment with SPX bullish and VIX low volatility despite DXY strength"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold maintains its breakout regime despite today's minor pullback from 4631.65 high. The technical structure remains robust with price above all moving averages (EMA_BULL_STACK), strong momentum indicators (MACD bullish with positive histogram, ADX showing strong trend strength), and high volatility regime supporting continued momentum. While RSI (69.47) and Stochastic (K:92.44) show overbought conditions, these are typical in strong breakouts and don't yet indicate reversal. The strong accumulation (0.6) confirms institutional participation remains robust. Cross-asset analysis shows mixed signals with DXY strength potentially providing headwinds, but SPX maintains bullish structure and VIX remains in low volatility regime, indicating sustained risk-on sentiment. The minor pullback appears healthy within the broader breakout context.",
    "confidence": 0.86,
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI approaching overbought at 69.47 and Stochastic extremely overbought (K:92.44) suggest near-term pullback risk",
      "DXY showing strong bullish signals (ABOVE_CLOUD, MFI_OB, CCI_OB) could pressure gold if dollar strength continues",
      "High volatility regime (83.37%) may lead to sharp reversals or increased price swings",
      "CCI overbought at 131.07 indicates potential momentum exhaustion",
      "Intraday range from 4631.65 high to 4580.81 low shows continued volatility and profit-taking",
      "Consolidation probability at 0.5 suggests potential for pause within the broader breakout trend"
