    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4339.9, high 4372.9, low 4273.81, closed at 4317.2 near the 20‑day Bollinger middle band (4317.29). Volume was high (368,932). PSAR (4549.3) sits above price, indicating bearish short‑term pressure.",
    "momentum": "RSI 52.69 (neutral), MACD 65.37 vs signal 73.92 (histogram -8.55, bearish), ADX 31.49 with +DI 23.96 > -DI 22.39 (strong uptrend). Stochastic K 32.76/D 39.27 (below 50).",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT 77.75%, PARK_VOL 0.0121). Hurst 0.3983 suggests short‑term mean‑reversion. Efficiency low (0.1778).",
    "cross_assets": "S&P500 modestly lower (close 6849.8, ADX 12.65, -DI > +DI), VIX low and bearish (C 16.48, ADX 16.24, -DI > +DI), DXY weakening (C 97.97, ADX 26.35, -DI > +DI, SIG STRONG_DOWN). Overall risk‑on backdrop with a softening dollar and subdued fear."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "RISK_ON",
    "trend": "Gold is in a short‑term pull‑back within a broader up‑trend. ADX remains strong, but MACD histogram has turned negative and price sits below the PSAR, suggesting a possible corrective leg before resuming higher.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Strong ADX (31.5) with +DI dominance confirming underlying uptrend",
      "Weakening US dollar (DXY) removing head‑winds for gold",
      "Low VIX indicating limited risk‑off pressure",
      "High volatility regime providing room for a directional move",
      "Bullish EMA stack (SIG:STRONG_UP) keeping longer‑term bias positive"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The combination of a robust ADX trend, a depreciating dollar, and a complacent VIX creates a risk‑on environment that supports gold despite the current pull‑back. Price remains above key support levels (20‑day SMA, POC) and the EMA stack stays bullish, suggesting the down‑move may be a temporary correction. High volatility indicates the market is primed for a breakout once the short‑term weakness resolves.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "Negative MACD histogram and PSAR above price signal potential near‑term reversal",
      "RSI near neutral (52.7) – loss of bullish momentum could deepen the pull‑back",
      "High volatility may produce rapid swings or false breakouts",
      "A sudden rebound in the dollar could cap gold upside"
