    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4317.2 after trading between 4273.81-4372.9, maintaining position above key EMAs (E21:4318.42, E50:4187.56) but below E9 (4370.49), showing continued consolidation with price inside Bollinger Bands (BBM:4317.29) and testing lower support levels",
    "momentum": "RSI neutral at 52.69, MACD bearish with declining histogram (-8.55) and signal line above MACD (73.92 > 65.37), ADX at 31.49 showing moderate trend strength with +DI > -DI (23.96 > 22.39), Stochastic neutral (K:32.76, D:39.27)",

    "cross_assets": "DXY showing continued weakness (STRONG_DOWN, BELOW_CLOUD, RSI 41.77) supporting gold, SPX in weak trend (WEAK_TREND, ABOVE_CLOUD) with neutral momentum, VIX in bearish EMA stack with low volatility (VOL_PCT: 17.26%) indicating stable risk environment"

    "regime": "CONSOLIDATION",
    "trend": "Bullish trend intact but in clear consolidation phase - price holding above critical EMA supports (E21:4318.42, E50:4187.56) but below short-term E9, maintaining inside Bollinger Bands with neutral momentum indicators",
    "key_drivers": [
      "MACD bearish configuration with negative histogram (-8.55) confirming momentum deceleration",
      "High volatility regime (79.0%) with mean-reverting properties supporting consolidation digestion",
      "DXY continued weakness (STRONG_DOWN) providing underlying structural support for gold",
      "Price successfully defended E21 support at 4318.42 despite intraday test to 4273.81",
      "Negative accumulation (-0.0915) indicates ongoing profit-taking after recent explosive rally"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold continues its consolidation phase following the explosive breakout rally, with today's action showing a successful defense of the critical E21 support at 4318.42 despite testing lower levels intraday. The technical structure maintains its bullish foundation with price above key moving averages and supportive cross-asset signals (DXY weakness, low VIX). However, momentum indicators clearly show consolidation characteristics - neutral RSI, bearish MACD crossover, and declining histogram. The high volatility regime with strong mean-reverting properties (HURST 0.3983) supports this consolidation phase as healthy digestion of recent gains. The asset maintains above-cloud positioning and key supports, indicating this is a constructive pause rather than trend reversal.",
    "confidence": 0.84,
    "risk_factors": [
      "MACD bearish configuration with negative histogram suggests continued momentum deterioration",
      "High volatility regime (79.0%) may lead to increased price swings and uncertainty",
      "Negative accumulation (-0.0915) indicates persistent institutional selling pressure",
      "Intraday low of 4273.81 breached key support levels, suggesting vulnerability to further downside",
      "Potential for deeper pullback toward E50 support at 4187 if consolidation extends"
