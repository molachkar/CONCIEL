    "price_action": "Gold closed at 4331.57 after trading between 4309.62-4401.93, maintaining position above key EMAs (E21:4319.61, E50:4193.21) but below E9 (4362.71), showing continued consolidation with price inside Bollinger Bands (BBM:4323.74) and testing support/resistance levels",
    "momentum": "RSI neutral at 54.01, MACD bearish with negative histogram (-12.55) and signal line above MACD (70.78 > 58.23), ADX at 29.85 showing moderate trend strength with +DI > -DI (24.53 > 20.67), Stochastic oversold (K:25.52, D:33.59)",

    "regime": "CONSOLIDATION",
    "trend": "Bullish trend intact but in extended consolidation phase - price holding above critical EMA supports (E21:4319.61, E50:4193.21) but below short-term E9, maintaining inside Bollinger Bands with neutral to bearish momentum indicators",
    "key_drivers": [
      "MACD bearish configuration with negative histogram (-12.55) confirming ongoing momentum deceleration",
      "High volatility regime (80.67%) with strong mean-reverting properties supporting consolidation digestion",
      "DXY showing slight bounce but maintaining bearish structure (STRONG_DOWN, BELOW_CLOUD)",
      "Price successfully defended E21 support at 4319.61 despite intraday test to 4309.62",
      "Negative accumulation (-0.2996) indicates persistent institutional profit-taking after recent explosive rally",
      "Stochastic oversold conditions (K:25.52) suggesting potential for near-term bounce within consolidation range"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold continues its consolidation phase following the explosive December breakout, with today's action showing a successful defense of the critical E21 support at 4319.61 despite testing lower levels intraday. The technical structure maintains its bullish foundation with price above key moving averages and supportive cross-asset environment (low VIX, stable SPX). However, momentum indicators clearly show consolidation characteristics - neutral RSI, bearish MACD crossover, declining histogram, and oversold Stochastic. The high volatility regime with strong mean-reverting properties (HURST 0.3887) supports this extended consolidation phase as healthy digestion of recent gains. The asset maintains above-cloud positioning and key supports, indicating this remains a constructive pause rather than trend reversal.",

    "risk_factors": [
      "MACD bearish configuration with negative histogram suggests continued momentum deterioration",
      "High volatility regime (80.67%) may lead to increased price swings and uncertainty",
      "Negative accumulation (-0.2996) indicates persistent institutional selling pressure",
      "Intraday low of 4309.62 approached key support levels, suggesting vulnerability to further downside",
      "Potential for deeper pullback toward E50 support at 4193 if consolidation extends further",
      "DXY showing MACD bullish crossover could signal temporary dollar strength, potentially pressuring gold"
