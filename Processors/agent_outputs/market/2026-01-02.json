    "price_action": "Gold (XAUUSD) closed at 4331.57, slightly above opening (4323.9) but well below session high (4401.93) and near session low (4309.62). Price remains above E21 (4319.61) and E50 (4193.21) but below E9 (4362.71) and Bollinger Band upper (4514.44). Session range 4309.62-4401.93 shows continued rejection from highs and consolidation within recent range.",
    "momentum": "Gold shows mixed momentum signals: RSI neutral (54.01), MACD bearish (58.23 vs SIG 70.78, HIST -12.55), ADX moderate trend strength (29.85). Positive DI (24.53) exceeds negative DI (20.67) indicating ongoing bullish pressure despite MACD weakness. Signals: STRONG_UP, IN_CLOUD.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT: 79.42%, ATR: 85.79) with mean-reverting state (HURST: 0.3887). Negative accumulation (-0.2996) suggests underlying selling pressure. Efficiency low (0.2024) indicating choppy price action.",
    "cross_assets": "DXY weak (STRONG_DOWN, BELOW_CLOUD, MACD_BULL_X) but showing slight strength. S&P500 neutral (WEAK_TREND, MACD_BEAR_X, ABOVE_CLOUD). VIX bearish (EMA_BEAR_STACK, WEAK_TREND, BELOW_CLOUD, CCI_OS, WILL_OS) indicating low fear environment. Overall cross-asset signals mixed but generally supportive for gold."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "CONSOLIDATION",
    "trend": "Gold continues consolidation phase within 4300-4400 range, showing rejection from highs and choppy price action. Underlying bullish structure remains intact above key EMAs but facing short-term resistance and momentum weakness.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Rejection from session high (4401.93) and close near middle of range (4331.57) indicating continued range-bound trading",
      "MACD bearish divergence with negative histogram (-12.55) confirming short-term momentum weakness",
      "High volatility regime (79.42%) with mean-reverting characteristics supporting consolidation",
      "Price holding above critical support levels (E21: 4319.61, E50: 4193.21) maintaining bullish structure",
      "Supportive cross-asset environment with DXY weakness and low VIX providing underlying support"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold's price action demonstrates continued consolidation with rejection from highs, choppy intraday movement, and mixed momentum signals. While the STRONG_UP signal and position above key EMAs maintain the underlying bullish structure, the MACD bearish divergence, high volatility, and failed breakout attempts indicate an ongoing consolidation phase within the 4300-4400 range. Cross-asset signals remain generally supportive but the high volatility and mean-reverting state suggest continued range-bound trading rather than directional breakout.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "MACD bearish divergence and negative histogram may lead to further short-term weakness",
      "High volatility regime (79.42%) increases position risk and potential for sharp moves",
      "Negative accumulation (-0.2996) suggests continued underlying selling pressure",
      "Risk of breaking below key E21 support (4319.61) if consolidation continues",
      "Mean-reverting state suggests potential for continued choppy, range-bound trading"
