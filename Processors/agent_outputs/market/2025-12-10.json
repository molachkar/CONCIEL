    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200)",
      "Above cloud positioning with strong Ichimoku signals and positive accumulation (0.3682)",
      "RSI improvement to 62.6 showing renewed bullish momentum with room for further upside",

    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates strong breakout continuation after recent consolidation, closing at 4227.65 with significant intraday recovery from lows. Price remains well above all major moving averages with improving momentum indicators (RSI 62.6, MACD positive histogram). The successful defense of the 4181 level and close near session highs shows underlying strength. High volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. Cross-asset signals remain highly favorable with VIX at new lows (16.66) with extreme oversold conditions and DXY showing continued weakness with oversold readings, creating optimal conditions for gold appreciation. The recovery aligns with the broader breakout structure observed in previous days.",

      "Stochastic showing overbought signals (K:84.84, D:76.81)",
      "High volatility regime may indicate increased price swings",
      "Price approaching upper Bollinger Band resistance at 4277.87",
      "VIX at extreme oversold levels may be due for mean reversion",
      "MACD histogram showing minimal positive divergence (0.4)"
