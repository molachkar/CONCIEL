    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4446.73, surged to a high of 4497.05, held above key EMAs (E9 4402.5, E21 4346.03, E50 4214.59) and closed at 4493.19 near the session high on moderate volume. The close is well above the prior day's high (4455.43) and above the 20‑day BB middle (4350.58).",
    "momentum": "RSI 65.84 (bullish), MACD 66.56 vs signal 68.42 (histogram -1.86, narrowing), ADX 28.56 with +DI 28.31 > -DI 17.55 (strong uptrend). Stochastic K 79.71/D 56.28, WILL -20.29, CCI 112.64, MFI 62.32.",
    "volatility": "High volatility regime (VOL_PCT 81.5%, PARK_VOL 0.0127), mean‑reverting Hurst 0.3799, efficiency 0.3769, accumulation positive (0.3954).",
    "cross_assets": "S&P500 bullish (close 6944.94, EMA bull stack, MACD histogram +2.58, RSI 61.02). VIX low and bearish (close 16.13, ADX 17.17, -DI > +DI). Dollar weak/neutral (close 98.32, ADX 22.27, mixed DI signals, in cloud). Overall risk‑on backdrop."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is executing a clear breakout above the recent 4300‑4450 consolidation range, confirming the underlying uptrend. Momentum indicators are bullish, and price is firmly above major moving averages and support levels.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Strong price advance: close 4493.19 near session high, breaking prior resistance around 4450.",
      "Bullish momentum: RSI 65.84, ADX 28.56 with +DI dominance, MACD histogram narrowing.",
      "Supportive cross‑asset environment: weak dollar, rising S&P500, low VIX indicating risk‑on sentiment.",
      "High volatility regime providing room for rapid moves while efficiency improves."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The combination of a decisive price breakout, robust trend strength (ADX +DI), and a risk‑on macro backdrop (weakening dollar, bullish equity market, low fear) aligns with a breakout regime. The price remains above all key EMAs and the 20‑day Bollinger middle, reinforcing the bullish bias. High volatility, while increasing short‑term risk, also fuels the momentum needed for a sustained move.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "High volatility (81.5%) could produce sharp pullbacks or false breakouts.",
      "Approaching the upper Bollinger Band (BBU 4541.45) may act as near‑term resistance.",
      "MACD histogram still negative, indicating residual bearish pressure that could surface on a pullback.",
      "If the dollar rebounds sharply, gold could face renewed downside pressure."
