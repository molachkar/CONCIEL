    "trend": "Strong bullish trend resumption after brief consolidation, maintaining above all EMAs, bullish Ichimoku cloud positioning, and improving momentum indicators",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200)",
      "Above cloud positioning with strong Ichimoku signals",
      "RSI improvement to 60.48 showing renewed bullish momentum",
      "VIX remaining at low levels (17.63) supporting risk-on environment",
      "DXY neutral consolidation reducing downward pressure on gold"

    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates breakout resumption after yesterday's consolidation, closing at 4207.07 with strong recovery from intraday lows. Price remains well above all major moving averages with improving momentum indicators (RSI 60.48, MACD positive). The successful defense of EMA support and close near session highs shows underlying strength. High volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. Cross-asset signals remain favorable with VIX at low levels supporting risk-on sentiment and DXY showing neutral consolidation, creating optimal conditions for gold appreciation. The recovery from consolidation aligns with the broader breakout structure.",
