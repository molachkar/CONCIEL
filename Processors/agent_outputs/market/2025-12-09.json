    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Strong bullish trend continuation with successful test of support at 4169.85 and recovery to close above 4200, maintaining position above all EMAs with bullish stack configuration and above cloud positioning",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200)",
      "Above cloud positioning with strong Ichimoku signals",
      "RSI in healthy bullish zone (60.48) with room for further upside",
      "VIX decline to 17.63 with oversold conditions continuing risk-on environment",
      "DXY consolidation with weak trend supporting gold appreciation"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates breakout continuation with strong recovery from intraday lows. Price remains well above all major moving averages with supportive momentum indicators (RSI 60.48, MACD positive). The successful defense of the 4170 support level and close above 4200 shows underlying strength. High volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. Cross-asset signals remain favorable with VIX at low levels (17.63) with oversold conditions and DXY showing continued consolidation/weakness, creating supportive conditions for gold appreciation.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "MACD histogram showing minimal positive divergence (0.11)",
      "Stochastic showing potential overbought signals (K:76.35, D:73.5)",
      "High volatility regime may indicate increased price swings",
      "Price approaching upper Bollinger Band resistance at 4273.06"
