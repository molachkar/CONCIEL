  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is in a strong uptrend with accelerating momentum and clear breakout signals. S&P500 is modestly bullish but lacks strong trend conviction. VIX remains subdued, and DXY is weakening, removing downside pressure.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stacking and BB_BREAKOUT_UP on Gold",
      "High ADX (+DI dominance) confirming a strong trend",
      "Very high volume supporting price move",
      "Weak DXY (oversold, downtrend) reducing dollar headwinds",
      "Low VIX indicating limited risk‑off pressure"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The confluence of an overbought yet still rising RSI, strong ADX, bullish EMA stack, and a Bollinger Band breakout signals a continuation of the gold breakout. Cross‑asset context shows a softening dollar and low market fear, both of which historically support risk‑on dynamics while allowing gold to ride its own momentum. Medium volatility suggests the move can sustain without immediate mean‑reversion pressure.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "Gold is deeply overbought (RSI 79.5, CCI 176.59, WILL -13.34) – potential short‑term pullback",
      "Medium volatility regime may lead to mean‑reversion if buying pressure wanes",
      "A sudden spike in VIX or a rapid DXY rebound could trigger risk‑off sentiment and curb the breakout"
