  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Extremely strong bullish momentum with powerful breakout continuation - price broke above upper Bollinger Band, maintained position well above all moving averages with EMA_BULL_STACK signal, closed near session highs, and achieved new highs above 4760 with accelerating momentum indicators",
    "key_drivers": [
      "EMA_BULL_STACK signal with price well above all key EMAs confirming robust bullish structure",
      "MACD strongly bullish with positive histogram (16.85) showing momentum acceleration",
      "BB_BREAKOUT_UP signal with price breaking above upper Bollinger Band (4739.92)",
      "High volatility regime (86.9%) supporting momentum continuation with mean-reverting properties",
      "Strong positive accumulation (0.6539) indicating sustained institutional buying pressure",
      "Risk-off environment with SPX weakness and VIX breakout supporting safe-haven flows"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates an exceptionally powerful breakout continuation with today's action showing new highs at 4766.15 and breaking above the upper Bollinger Band. The technical structure remains extremely robust with price above all moving averages (EMA_BULL_STACK), strong momentum indicators (MACD bullish with positive histogram, ADX showing strong trend strength), and high volatility regime supporting continued momentum. Despite overbought conditions (RSI 75.49, Stochastic extreme), the breakout shows no signs of exhaustion. Cross-asset analysis reveals a strongly supportive risk-off environment with SPX showing breakdown signals (BB_BREAKOUT_DN, CCI_OS) and VIX breaking out higher, indicating increased market fear that typically benefits gold as a safe-haven asset. DXY weakness further supports gold's upward move. The combination of technical breakout strength and favorable cross-asset context confirms continuation of the BREAKOUT regime.",
    "confidence": 0.89,
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI extremely overbought at 75.49 suggests elevated near-term pullback risk",
      "Stochastic extremely overbought (K:98.74, D:93.53) indicates potential momentum exhaustion",
      "CCI extremely overbought at 168.81 suggests stretched momentum conditions",
      "High volatility regime (86.9%) may lead to sharp reversals or increased price swings",
      "VIX breakout to 20.08 indicates significant market stress that could affect all assets",
      "Price breaking above upper Bollinger Band may face resistance and mean reversion pressure"
