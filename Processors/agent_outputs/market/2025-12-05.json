    "momentum": "Gold shows strong momentum with RSI at 59.78 and MACD histogram positive (3.6). ADX at 21.21 indicates a strengthening trend. S&P500 has neutral momentum. VIX momentum is weak. DXY momentum is neutral.",
    "volatility": "Gold and S&P500 are in high volatility regimes (VOL_PCT 81.08 and 79.0 respectively). VIX is also in a high volatility regime (VOL_PCT 66.53). DXY is in a low volatility regime (VOL_PCT 4.99).",

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "RISK_ON",
    "trend": "Gold is in a strong uptrend, supported by bullish technicals and high volatility. S&P500's high volatility suggests potential for movement, but no clear trend is indicated. VIX's high volatility could signal increasing uncertainty, but current levels are not extreme. DXY's low volatility removes a potential headwind for risk assets.",

    "reasoning": "The combination of Gold's strong uptrend, S&P500's high volatility (potential for movement), and DXY's inactivity suggests a RISK_ON environment. VIX's high volatility is noted but not currently extreme enough to counter the risk-on signals.",
