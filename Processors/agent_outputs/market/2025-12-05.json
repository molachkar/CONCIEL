    "trend": "Strong bullish trend continuation with healthy consolidation, maintaining above all EMAs, bullish Ichimoku cloud positioning, and supportive momentum indicators despite minor pullback",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Bullish EMA stack configuration maintained (E9 > E21 > E50 > E200)",

    "reasoning": "Gold demonstrates breakout continuation despite minor consolidation. Price remains well above all major moving averages with strong momentum indicators (RSI 59.78, MACD positive). The successful test of support at 4191.81 and recovery to close near 4200 shows underlying strength. High volatility regime with mean-reverting properties suggests continued upward momentum potential. Cross-asset signals remain highly favorable with VIX at new lows (17.17) with oversold conditions and DXY showing continued weakness/consolidation with oversold readings, creating optimal conditions for gold appreciation. The consolidation appears healthy within the broader breakout structure.",
