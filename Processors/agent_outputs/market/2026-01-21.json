    "price_action": "Gold opened at 4761.74, high 4888.07, low 4755.35, closed at 4831.69. Close is well above all major EMAs (E9 4656.35, E21 4538.26, E50 4360.43, E200 3795.08) and VWAP (4516.65). PSAR (4458.5) sits far below price.",
    "momentum": "RSI 78.22 (overbought). MACD line 118.69 above signal 95.43 with a large positive histogram (+23.26). ADX 33.31 with +DI 41.12 > -DI 11.85 indicating a strong uptrend. Stochastic K/D 90.25/94.74 (overbought).",
    "volatility": "Volatility regime is high (VOL_PCT 86.49%). Hurst 0.3508 (mean‑reverting). Accumulation 0.6028, efficiency 0.3867 – volatility is being channeled into directional buying pressure.",
    "cross_assets": "Dollar index (DXY) is weak/neutral (close 98.57, near cloud, weak trend). S&P500 shows a weak downtrend (ADX 12.6, -DI > +DI). VIX remains low but shows a weak upward breakout, indicating low overall market fear. Macro backdrop remains risk‑on for gold."

  "analysis": {
    "regime": "BREAKOUT",
    "trend": "Gold is executing a strong bullish breakout, trading above all key moving averages, the 20‑day Bollinger middle, and even above the upper Bollinger band, with PSAR far below price. Momentum indicators are firmly bullish and volume is high.",
    "key_drivers": [
      "Close at 4831.69 above all major EMAs and VWAP.",
      "Price broke above the upper Bollinger band (BBU 4797.69).",
      "MACD bullish crossover with a large positive histogram (+23.26).",
      "ADX 33.3 with +DI dominance confirms a robust uptrend.",
      "High‑volatility regime with positive accumulation (0.6028) and efficiency (0.3867).",
      "Weak dollar and a faltering equity market provide a supportive risk‑on backdrop."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The price action decisively breaches the upper Bollinger band while staying above all trend‑line supports (EMAs, VWAP, PSAR). MACD, ADX, and +DI all signal strong upward momentum, and the high‑volatility environment is being efficiently converted into buying pressure as shown by accumulation and efficiency metrics. Cross‑asset signals reinforce the bullish bias: a softening DXY removes a headwind, equities are weak and not competing for capital, and VIX remains low, keeping risk appetite tilted toward safe‑haven gold. These combined factors point to a breakout regime.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "RSI and Stochastic are deep in overbought territory, raising the risk of a short‑term pull‑back.",
      "Price is already above the upper Bollinger band, which may act as near‑term resistance and trigger profit‑taking.",
      "High volatility (86% of typical volume) could produce sharp reversals or false breakouts.",
      "Any unexpected rebound in the dollar index or sudden equity rally could dampen gold's upside."
