    "inflation": "CPI YoY calculated as ((326.03 - 325.03) / 325.03) * 100 = 0.31% for the month, but for the year: assuming November's value is for November and using the provided value for the previous month (325.03) as a base for the year-over-year calculation is not accurate without the full year's data. However, given the monthly change, we can estimate the annualized rate. For simplicity and due to the lack of a full year's data, we'll calculate the YoY change from the two given months which might not accurately represent the full year's inflation rate. Thus, CPI YoY = ((326.03 / 325.03) - 1) * 100 = 0.31% for the month. To get a yearly rate, we annualize this: (1 + 0.0031)^12 - 1 = 3.81%",

    "reasoning": "The regime is considered NEUTRAL because the real rate, although slightly positive, indicates a stable monetary environment. The decrease in FEDFUNDS rate suggests a dovish stance by the Fed, which could lead to a RISK_ON regime if the trend continues. However, the current inflation rate does not strongly indicate a need for significant monetary policy adjustments.",
