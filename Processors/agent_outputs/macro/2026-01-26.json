    "reasoning": "The real rate of 1.52% is relatively high, which could be bearish for gold. However, the mixed economic data, including beats in CORE_DURABLE_GOODS_ORDERS and DURABLE_GOODS_ORDERS_(MOM), and a meet in ATLANTA_FED_GDPNOW__(Q4), suggests a neutral trend. The lack of historical context and unknown factors make it difficult to determine the overall regime.",
