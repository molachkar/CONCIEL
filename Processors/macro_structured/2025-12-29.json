        "reasoning": "Gold's price has retreated from its recent high but remains above key support levels (POC, 20‑day SMA) and exhibits bullish momentum (MACD, ADX). The high volatility regime suggests the market is primed for a directional move. Concurrently, the dollar is in a downtrend and the VIX is at multi‑year lows, both of which typically favor risk assets like gold and equities. Hence the dominant market environment is risk‑on, with gold likely to break higher if it clears the recent high of 4549.",
