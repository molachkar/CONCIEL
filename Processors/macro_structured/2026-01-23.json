        "cross_assets": "DXY is weak/oversold (RSI 33.6, EMA bear stack, below cloud) – normally supportive of gold. S&P500 shows a weak downtrend (ADX 12.33, -DI > +DI) with low momentum. VIX remains low but shows a weak upward breakout, indicating limited fear. Overall macro backdrop is mixed: a soft dollar and subdued equity market, but the price action contradicts the supportive cross‑asset environment."

        "reasoning": "The combination of a dramatic price drop into the low‑4000s, well below prior EMA and Bollinger levels, together with a high‑volatility regime, points to a breakdown rather than a consolidation. Although accumulation remains positive, it reflects that buyers are attempting to step in amid the sell‑off, but the force of the decline outweighs that support. Cross‑asset signals (weak DXY, soft equity market) would normally be bullish for gold, highlighting that the breakdown is driven primarily by technical pressure rather than macro fundamentals.",

          "Absence of concrete momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) makes it harder to gauge whether the sell‑off is overbought‑driven or fundamental.",
