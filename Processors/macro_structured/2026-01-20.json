Momentum metrics (MACD, ADX, +DI) confirm a strong uptrend, and the high‑volatility regime is being efficiently converted into buying pressure as shown by accumulation and efficiency scores. Cross‑asset signals reinforce the picture: a softening dollar removes a headwind, equities are weak and not competing for capital, and VIX, although rising, remains low enough to keep risk appetite tilted toward gold. These combined factors point to a clear breakout regime.",
