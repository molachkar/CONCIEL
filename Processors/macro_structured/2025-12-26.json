However, given the monthly change, we can estimate the annualized rate. For simplicity and due to the lack of a full year's data, we'll calculate the YoY change from the two given months which might not accurately represent the full year's inflation rate. Thus, CPI YoY = ((326.03 / 325.03) - 1) * 100 = 0.31% for the month. To get a yearly rate, we annualize this: (1 + 0.0031)^12 - 1 = 3.81%",
