## Report Generation Process

### Architecture Overview

**Sequential Multi-Agent System:**
- Each agent reads ALL 53 daily JSON files
- Each agent reads previous agents' outputs (cumulative knowledge)
- Each agent writes 4-6 pages focused on their domain
- Each agent MUST end with explicit handoff directive
- No rate-limit interruptions (agents plan output length)

**Critical Principle:** Each agent analyzes their primary domain (macro/market/narrative) BUT validates findings against other domains using the full dataset.

---

## Agent 1: Macro-Centric Cross-Asset Analysis

### Input Data
- All 53 JSON files from `macro_structured/`
- Focus on: `agents.macro.*` data
- Cross-reference: `agents.market.data_snapshot.cross_assets` (DXY, S&P500, VIX)
- Cross-reference: `agents.narrative.analysis.regime` for risk sentiment

### Analysis Objectives

1. **Macro Regime Evolution (Core Focus)**
   - FEDFUNDS trajectory over 53 days
   - Real Rate calculation and path: `T10Y - CPI_YoY`
   - Inflation dynamics: CPI, Michigan 1-year, Michigan 5-year expectations
   - Identify regime shifts (RISK_ON → RISK_OFF transitions)
   - Dovish vs Hawkish trend changes

2. **Cross-Asset Validation (Evidence Layer)**
   - Correlate DXY weakness periods with gold price movements
   - Analyze S&P500 trend alignment with risk regimes
   - VIX behavior during macro regime transitions
   - Calculate correlation coefficients where meaningful

3. **Market Technical Confirmation (Supporting Evidence)**
   - Do ADX trend strength readings align with dovish/hawkish periods?
   - RSI momentum shifts timing vs real rate inflection points
   - Gold price breakouts vs real rate compression events

4. **Narrative Integration (Context Layer)**
   - Risk-on/risk-off sentiment timing vs FEDFUNDS changes
   - Geopolitical risk windows impact on macro regime confidence
   - Dominant story themes correlation with economic data releases

### Output Structure (4-5 pages)

```
PART I: MACRO REGIME ANALYSIS

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (0.5 pages)
   - Overview of 53-day macro regime evolution
   - Key inflection points with dates
   - Primary drivers (FEDFUNDS path, real rate trajectory, inflation)

2. FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY TRAJECTORY (1.5 pages)
   - FEDFUNDS evolution: opening rate → closing rate
   - Identify distinct phases (e.g., Dec 1-10 dovish, Dec 11-20 neutral, etc.)
   - Paragraph narrative explaining each phase
   - Bullet points ONLY for rate timeline:
     • Dec 1: 4.09%
     • Dec 8: 3.72% (dovish shift)
     • Dec 15: 3.85% (consolidation)
     [etc.]

3. REAL RATE REGIME ANALYSIS (1.5 pages)
   - Real rate calculation methodology
   - Full 53-day real rate path with phase identification
   - Correlation with gold price movements (from market data)
   - Example: "Real rate compression Dec 1-8 (4.35% → 3.85%) 
     coincided with gold breakout above 4200 resistance. This 
     wasn't coincidental—the 50bp decline in real borrowing 
     costs typically triggers 2-3% gold appreciation within 
     5 trading days historically."

4. CROSS-ASSET CORRELATION PATTERNS (1 page)
   - DXY inverse correlation analysis
     - Identify periods: DXY down, gold up
     - Calculate correlation coefficient
     - Highlight divergences (if any)
   - S&P500 risk-on confirmation
     - Periods where stocks + gold both rallied (atypical)
     - Periods of negative correlation
   - VIX behavior as regime validator
     - Low VIX (<18) periods → risk-on confirmation
     - VIX spikes → regime uncertainty

5. INFLATION DYNAMICS (0.5 pages)
   - CPI YoY trajectory
   - Michigan inflation expectations (1-year vs 5-year divergence)
   - Impact on real rate calculations

[HANDOFF TO AGENT_2]
Macro regime analysis complete. Key findings for technical validation:

• 3 distinct regime phases identified:
  - Phase 1 (Dec 1-10): Dovish shift, FEDFUNDS 4.09% → 3.72%, real rate compression
  - Phase 2 (Dec 11-25): Consolidation, FEDFUNDS stable 3.7-3.8%
  - Phase 3 (Dec 26-Jan 23): [describe]

• Real rate inflection points requiring technical confirmation:
  - Dec 8: Real rate 3.85% (from 4.35%)
  - [other key dates]

• DXY inverse correlation: -0.87 (strong)
• Risk-on regime dominant: 38 of 53 days

Agent_2 Tasks:
1. Validate gold price breakouts align with Dec 8 macro inflection
2. Analyze RSI/ADX behavior during Phase 2 consolidation
3. Confirm volatility clustering around regime transition dates
4. Cross-check EMA configuration changes with real rate trajectory

Continue analysis from this point.
```

### Writing Guidelines for Agent 1

**Prose Quality:**
- Financial Times / Bloomberg Intelligence style
- Each paragraph = one clear argument
- No wall-of-text (max 6-8 lines per paragraph)
- Strategic whitespace between sections

**Bullet Point Usage:**
- Data tables (rate timelines, key statistics)
- Multi-factor lists (risk factors, key drivers)
- NOT for analytical reasoning (use paragraphs)

**Cross-Domain Integration:**
- When discussing real rate compression, cite gold price response
- When identifying dovish shifts, reference narrative sentiment scores
- When analyzing DXY, show gold price correlation

**Causal Language:**
- "This caused..." (when confident)
- "This likely contributed to..." (when probable)
- "Coincided with..." (when timing matches but causality unclear)
- Always justify confidence levels

PART II: MARKET TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

1. PRICE STRUCTURE EVOLUTION (1.5 pages)
   - Opening statement: "Gold appreciated X% over 53 days, from 
     [start price] to [end price], characterized by [number] 
     distinct structural phases."
   
   - Phase breakdown narrative:
     • Phase 1 (Dec 1-10): Breakout above 4200 resistance
       - Trigger: Agent_1 identified Dec 8 real rate compression
       - Technical confirmation: RSI crossed 70 on Dec 9 (1-day lag)
       - EMA configuration: Bullish stack established (E9 > E21 > E50)
       - Price action: 4150 → 4320 (+4.1%)
     
     • Phase 2 (Dec 11-25): Consolidation
       - Macro context: FEDFUNDS stabilized 3.7-3.8% (Agent_1)
       - Technical behavior: Range-bound 4280-4350
       - RSI cooled to 60-65 (healthy retracement)
       - Support held at E21 (4235) throughout
     
     [Continue for remaining phases]
   
   - Support/Resistance Table:
     Key Level | Type       | Tests | Outcome
     ----------|------------|-------|----------
     4200      | Resistance | 3     | Broken Dec 8
     4350      | Resistance | 5     | Active
     4150      | Support    | 2     | Held

2. MOMENTUM REGIME ANALYSIS (1.5 pages)
   - RSI trajectory narrative
     - Identify sustained overbought periods (>70 for 5+ days)
     - Correlation with Agent_1's risk-on regime days
     - Divergences: RSI declining while price rising (bearish)
   
   - MACD signal analysis
     - Bullish crossovers: dates and price response
     - Histogram expansion/contraction phases
     - Alignment with macro inflection points
   
   - ADX trend strength evolution
     - Trending regimes (ADX >25): dates and characteristics
     - Ranging regimes (ADX <20): duration and resolution
     - +DI/-DI directional shifts
   
   Example paragraph:
   "The Dec 8-15 period exhibited the strongest momentum alignment 
   across all indicators. RSI surged from 65 to 74 (entering 
   overbought but sustainable given breakout context), MACD 
   histogram expanded from 3.2 to 6.9 (accelerating bullish 
   momentum), and ADX climbed from 22 to 28.5 (confirming trend 
   strength). This technical confluence occurred exactly as 
   Agent_1's macro analysis identified real rate compression from 
   4.35% to 3.85%—a textbook correlation."

3. VOLATILITY CHARACTERIZATION (1 page)
   - ATR evolution (identify expansion/contraction cycles)
   - Volatility regime changes (VOL_PCT thresholds)
   - Hurst exponent interpretation:
     - H > 0.5: Trending (momentum strategies favorable)
     - H < 0.5: Mean-reverting (range strategies favorable)
     - H ≈ 0.5: Random walk
   - Accumulation patterns (positive = buying pressure)

4. CROSS-DOMAIN VALIDATION (1 page)
   - **Macro-Technical Alignment Score:**
     Calculate timing lag between Agent_1's macro inflections 
     and technical breakouts
     
     Example:
     Macro Event          | Date   | Technical Response      | Lag
     ---------------------|--------|-------------------------|-----
     Dovish shift         | Dec 8  | RSI >70                 | +1 day
     Real rate bottom     | Dec 15 | Price consolidation     | 0 days
     FEDFUNDS stabilize   | Dec 20 | ADX decline to 22       | +2 days
     
     Average lag: 1.0 days (strong alignment)
   
   - **Narrative-Technical Confluence:**
     - Risk-on sentiment days (from narrative data) vs price up-days
     - Correlation coefficient
     - Identify divergences (sentiment positive, price down)

5. FORWARD-LOOKING TECHNICAL SETUP (0.5 pages)
   - Current positioning (as of Jan 23)
   - Key levels to watch
   - Momentum sustainability assessment
   - Volatility regime implications

[HANDOFF TO AGENT_3]
Technical analysis complete. Key findings for narrative integration:

• Price structure: 2 major breakouts (Dec 8, Jan 5) aligned with 
  Agent_1's macro inflections, average lag 1.0 days

• Momentum sustainability: RSI overbought 18 of 53 days, but 
  historical precedent shows gold can sustain RSI >70 for 15-20 
  days in strong breakout regimes

• Volatility regime: Mean-reverting (Hurst 0.43 average), suggests 
  current trends may consolidate before next leg

• Technical-macro correlation: 0.89 (very strong)

• Critical technical levels validated:
  - 4200 resistance → support (broken Dec 8)
  - 4350 resistance (active, 5 tests, needs narrative catalyst)
  - E21 support (4235) held all consolidations

Agent_3 Tasks:
1. Analyze sentiment catalysts for Dec 8 and Jan 5 breakouts
2. Identify narrative themes during consolidation phases
3. Assess geopolitical risk timing vs volatility spikes
4. Synthesize macro + technical + narrative for forward probabilities

Continue final synthesis from this point.
```

### Writing Guidelines for Agent 2

**Evidence-Based Analysis:**
- Every technical claim must reference specific data points
- When stating "RSI was overbought," specify: "RSI at 74.2 on Dec 9"
- When claiming correlation, calculate and state coefficient

**Cross-Agent References:**
- "As Agent_1 identified..." (cite specific finding)
- "This confirms Agent_1's hypothesis that..." (validate or refute)
- "Agent_1's real rate data shows..." (integrate their analysis)

**Visualization Through Text:**
- Describe chart patterns in words
- Use ASCII tables for key statistics
- Paint the picture: "Gold carved a higher-low structure..."

---

## Agent 3: Narrative-Driven Synthesis + Forward Outlook

### Input Data
- All 53 JSON files from `macro_structured/`
- **Agent 1's complete output** (PART I)
- **Agent 2's complete output** (PART II)
- Focus on: `agents.narrative.*` data
- Full access to macro + market data for correlation analysis

### Analysis Objectives

1. **Sentiment Evolution (Core Focus)**
   - Dominant story themes over 53 days
   - Sentiment score trajectory (positive/negative/neutral distribution)
   - Geopolitical risk windows and impact
   - Risk-on vs risk-off narrative regime transitions

2. **Macro-Narrative Timing Analysis (Cross-Domain)**
   - Do risk-on headlines lead or lag Agent_1's dovish shifts?
   - Sentiment score changes around FEDFUNDS inflections
   - Narrative catalyst identification for real rate movements

3. **Market-Narrative Correlation (Cross-Domain)**
   - Breakout phases (Agent_2) alignment with sentiment >0.8
   - Consolidation phases alignment with neutral/negative sentiment
   - Volatility spikes (Agent_2) vs geopolitical risk windows

4. **Triple-Domain Pattern Recognition (Synthesis)**
   - Identify recurring patterns:
     Example: "Dovish Fed (macro) + DXY weakness + Risk-on narrative 
     → Gold breakout (market)" occurred X times, average price gain Y%
   
   - Failure modes:
     Example: "Dovish Fed + Risk-off narrative → Consolidation" 
     (macro-narrative conflict suppresses bullish response)

5. **Forward-Looking Regime Probabilities (Synthesis)**
   - Given current regime stack (as of Jan 23), historical analogs
   - Conditional probabilities based on pattern library
   - Risk scenarios and hedge considerations

### Output Structure (5-6 pages)

```
PART III: NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS & INTEGRATED OUTLOOK

1. SENTIMENT EVOLUTION (1.5 pages)
   - 53-day sentiment trajectory narrative
   - Dominant themes by period:
     • Dec 1-15: "Tech strength, cooling inflation" (Risk-on)
     • Dec 16-25: "Holiday thin liquidity, consolidation" (Neutral)
     • Dec 26-Jan 10: [theme] (Sentiment)
     [etc.]
   
   - Sentiment distribution:
     • Risk-on narrative: 35 days (66%)
     • Risk-off narrative: 8 days (15%)
     • Neutral: 10 days (19%)
   
   - Geopolitical risk windows:
     • Dec 12-14: [specific event], market impact: [describe]
     • Jan 8-10: [specific event], market impact: [describe]

2. MACRO-NARRATIVE TIMING CORRELATION (1.5 pages)
   - **Lead-Lag Analysis:**
     Research question: Do narratives predict macro shifts or react?
     
     Method: Compare Agent_1's regime change dates with narrative 
     sentiment shifts
     
     Findings:
     • Risk-on sentiment typically LEADS dovish Fed shifts by 2-3 days
     • Example: Dec 5-6 risk-on narrative intensified, Dec 8 FEDFUNDS 
       dropped (2-day lead)
     • This suggests markets price in Fed expectations before data
     
     Counter-examples:
     • Dec 20: Dovish continuation but narrative turned neutral 
       (disconnect, market hesitation)
   
   - **Catalysts for Real Rate Movements:**
     Agent_1 identified real rate compression Dec 1-8. Narrative 
     analysis shows:
     • Dec 1-3: "CPI cooling" headlines (15 instances)
     • Dec 4-6: "Fed dovish pivot speculation" (22 instances)
     • Dec 7-8: "Tech rally expands to cyclicals" (risk-on broadening)
     
     Narrative provided the expectation pathway that real rate data 
     confirmed.

3. MARKET-NARRATIVE CONFLUENCE (1.5 pages)
   - **Breakout Amplification:**
     Agent_2 identified 2 major breakouts (Dec 8, Jan 5)
     
     Dec 8 Breakout:
     • Technical: RSI 65 → 74, price +4.1%
     • Narrative: Sentiment 0.85 (strong positive), "inflation victory" theme
     • Confluence assessment: 9/10 (narrative amplified technical move)
     
     Jan 5 Breakout:
     • Technical: [describe from Agent_2]
     • Narrative: Sentiment [value], dominant theme [describe]
     • Confluence assessment: [score]/10
   
   - **Consolidation Phase Narrative:**
     Agent_2 identified Dec 11-25 consolidation
     • Narrative during period: Neutral sentiment 60% of days
     • Dominant story: "Holiday trading, thin liquidity"
     • Interpretation: Lack of narrative catalyst → technical stall
     • This confirms Agent_2's momentum cooling (RSI 74 → 62)
   
   - **Volatility-Geopolitics Correlation:**
     Cross-reference Agent_2's volatility spikes with geopolitical 
     risk windows
     
     ATR Spikes (Agent_2):          | Geopolitical Event:
     -------------------------------|--------------------------------
     Dec 13: ATR 72 (+15% vs avg)  | [specific event from narrative]
     Jan 9: ATR 68 (+12% vs avg)   | [specific event from narrative]
     
     Correlation: 0.78 (strong), geopolitics explains 78% of 
     volatility variance

4. TRIPLE-DOMAIN PATTERN LIBRARY (2 pages)
   **This is the synthesis core—identify recurring patterns across 
   all three domains**
   
   ### Pattern 1: "Dovish Breakout Cascade"
   **Conditions:**
   - Macro: FEDFUNDS decline >20bp within 5 days, real rate <4.0%
   - Market: Price above E9, RSI 60-75, ADX >25
   - Narrative: Risk-on sentiment >0.75
   
   **Occurrences:** 3 times in 53-day window
   - Dec 8-12
   - Jan 5-8
   - [if 3rd occurrence exists]
   
   **Outcome:**
   - Average gold price gain: +3.8% within 5 days
   - Success rate: 100% (3/3)
   - Average duration: 7 days before consolidation
   
   **Mechanism:**
   "Dovish Fed policy reduces opportunity cost of holding gold 
   (real rate compression), technical breakout confirms trend 
   strength, and risk-on narrative provides psychological 
   reinforcement for momentum traders. The confluence creates 
   self-reinforcing feedback loop."
   
   ### Pattern 2: "Macro-Narrative Divergence Stall"
   **Conditions:**
   - Macro: Dovish continuation (FEDFUNDS stable/declining)
   - Market: Consolidation (price range-bound, ADX <22)
   - Narrative: Risk-off or neutral sentiment <0.5
   
   **Occurrences:** 2 times
   - Dec 20-25
   - [if 2nd occurrence exists]
   
   **Outcome:**
   - Gold price change: -0.5% to +1.2% (minimal movement)
   - Duration: 5-8 days average
   - Resolution: Requires narrative catalyst to break
   
   **Mechanism:**
   "Despite favorable macro backdrop, lack of positive narrative 
   prevents new capital deployment. Technical consolidation reflects 
   this standoff. Historical resolution requires either narrative 
   improvement (Pattern 1 resumes) or macro deterioration 
   (Pattern 3 activates)."
   
   ### Pattern 3: "Risk-Off Compression"
   [If occurred in dataset, describe with same structure]
   
   ### Pattern 4: [Additional patterns]
   
   **Pattern Validation:**
   - Out of 53 days, 47 days (89%) fit one of identified patterns
   - 6 days (11%) showed idiosyncratic behavior
   - Pattern library has predictive value IF conditions repeat

5. FORWARD-LOOKING REGIME PROBABILITIES (1 page)
   **Current State (as of Jan 23):**
   - Macro: FEDFUNDS [value], Real Rate [value], Trend: [dovish/hawkish]
   - Market: Price [value], RSI [value], ADX [value], Above/below EMAs
   - Narrative: Sentiment [score], Dominant theme: [describe]
   
   **Pattern Matching:**
   Current regime most closely resembles:
   - Pattern [X]: [name] (80% match)
   - Historical analogs: [dates when similar setup occurred]
   
   **Scenario Analysis:**
   
   **Scenario A (60% probability): Pattern 1 Continuation**
   - If: FEDFUNDS remains <3.8%, narrative stays risk-on >0.7
   - Then: Gold likely tests 4400-4450 resistance within 10 days
   - Risk: Narrative shift to risk-off breaks pattern
   
   **Scenario B (25% probability): Pattern 2 Consolidation**
   - If: Narrative weakens to neutral while macro stable
   - Then: 4280-4350 range extends 5-10 more days
   - Resolution: Requires macro or narrative catalyst
   
   **Scenario C (15% probability): Risk-Off Reversal**
   - If: FEDFUNDS reversal or geopolitical shock
   - Then: Support test at 4200-4235 (E21/prior resistance)
   - Likelihood: Low given current macro trend, but tail risk exists
   
   **Risk Management Considerations:**
   - Key level to watch: 4235 (E21 support, Agent_2 validated)
   - Narrative monitoring: Sentiment <0.5 for 3+ consecutive days 
     = early warning
   - Macro tripwire: Real rate >4.2% invalidates dovish thesis

6. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT & LIMITATIONS (0.5 pages)
   **Analytical Confidence: 8.2/10**
   
   Confidence drivers:
   • Strong cross-domain correlations (macro-market: 0.89, 
     market-narrative: 0.78)
   • Pattern library validated across 89% of dataset
   • Agent alignment high (3 independent analyses converged)
   
   Uncertainty factors:
   • Narrative data has subjective sentiment scoring
   • 53-day window limited for rare event analysis
   • Forward probabilities assume regime stability
   • Black swan events (geopolitical shocks) not modeled
   
   **Usage Recommendation:**
   This report provides a probabilistic framework, not deterministic 
   predictions. Use pattern library as hypothesis generator, validate 
   real-time against incoming macro/market/narrative data. Update 
   probabilities as new information arrives.

### Writing Guidelines for Agent 3

**Synthesis Quality:**
- Don't just summarize Agents 1 & 2—find connections they couldn't see
- Pattern library is YOUR unique contribution
- Forward probabilities must be justified by historical analogs

**Intellectual Honesty:**
- State confidence levels with reasoning
- Acknowledge limitations explicitly
- Identify days that don't fit patterns (anomalies matter)

**Actionable Intelligence:**
- Scenario analysis should be decision-ready
- Risk management sections should be specific (levels, triggers)
- Don't hedge to uselessness—take positions with caveats

## Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Data Loading
```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Load all 53 JSON files
data_folder = Path("macro_structured")
daily_data = {}

for json_file in sorted(data_folder.glob("*.json")):
    date = json_file.stem  # e.g., "2025-12-19"
    with open(json_file) as f:
        daily_data[date] = json.load(f)

print(f"Loaded {len(daily_data)} days of data")
```

### Step 2: Agent 1 Execution
```python
# Prompt for Agent 1
agent1_prompt = f"""
You are Agent 1 in a multi-agent gold market analysis system.

INPUT DATA:
- 53 days of structured market data (2025-12-01 to 2026-01-23)
- Full JSON structure provided below

YOUR TASK:
Write PART I: MACRO REGIME ANALYSIS (4-5 pages)

Follow the structure outlined in REPORT_GENERATION_README.md:
1. Executive Summary
2. Federal Reserve Policy Trajectory  
3. Real Rate Regime Analysis
4. Cross-Asset Correlation Patterns
5. Inflation Dynamics
6. Handoff directive to Agent 2

WRITING QUALITY:

- Each paragraph advances clear argument
- Cross-reference market/narrative data as supporting evidence

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Analyze YOUR domain (macro) using ALL domains' data
- Calculate real rate for all 53 days: T10Y - CPI_YoY

- Validate macro findings against price action (market data)
- End with explicit handoff to Agent 2

DATA:
{json.dumps(daily_data, indent=2)}

BEGIN WRITING PART I:
"""

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Agent Siloing:** Each agent only analyzing their domain without cross-referencing others
   - Fix: Every agent MUST cite findings from other domains

2. **Bullet Point Overuse:** Turning report into slide deck
   - Fix: Bullets only for data tables, rest is prose

3. **Shallow Synthesis:** Agent 3 just summarizing Agents 1 & 2
   - Fix: Pattern library must reveal NEW insights not visible to prior agents

4. **Vague Handoffs:** "Agent 2, continue the analysis"
   - Fix: Specific tasks listed (e.g., "validate Dec 8 inflection timing")

5. **Unsubstantiated Claims:** "Gold will likely rise"
   - Fix: "Gold likely tests 4400 (60% probability, based on Pattern 1 
     which occurred 3 times with 100% success rate)"

6. **Ignoring Contradictions:** Dovish Fed but price down
   - Fix: Explicitly analyze anomalies (these are learning opportunities)

## Post-Generation: Token-Efficient Compression

**This step is MANUAL (you handle it after reviewing the human-readable report)**

Compression targets:
- Remove narrative prose, keep causal chains
- Convert paragraphs to structured data where possible
- Maintain all statistics and correlation coefficients
- Preserve pattern library (most information-dense section)
- Target: 50-60% size reduction while retaining analytical value

**Do NOT ask agents to generate compressed version—they produce 
human-readable first, compression is separate workflow.**

---

## FAQ

**Q: What if Agent 1 writes 8 pages instead of 4-5?**
A: Agent receives character budget in prompt. If exceeded, truncate 
   less-critical sections (e.g., reduce inflation dynamics to 0.25 pages).

**Q: What if agents don't cross-reference each other?**
A: Prompt explicitly requires citation. Example: "Agent 2 MUST validate 
   Agent 1's Dec 8 inflection against technical data and state findings."

**Q: What if Pattern Library finds no patterns?**
A: Unlikely with 53 days of data. Minimum: identify 2-3 patterns even if 
   they occurred only twice. Patterns with n=2 are still valuable.

**Q: What if forward probabilities are uncertain?**
A: State confidence explicitly. "Low confidence (5/10) due to limited 
   historical analogs for current regime configuration" is acceptable.

**Q: Can we parallelize agents instead of sequential?**
A: No—Agent 2 needs Agent 1's macro inflection dates, Agent 3 needs both 
   prior analyses. Sequential is architectural requirement.

## Example Prompt Snippets

### Agent 1 Prompt Addition
```
CRITICAL CROSS-DOMAIN TASK:
For every macro regime shift you identify (e.g., FEDFUNDS decline), 
you MUST check the market data for gold price response:

Example required structure:
"Real rate compressed from 4.35% to 3.85% on Dec 1-8. Cross-referencing 
market data shows gold rallied from 4150 to 4320 (+4.1%) during this 
period, with RSI crossing 70 on Dec 9. This validates the hypothesis 
that real rate compression triggers gold appreciation with 1-day lag."

If you find NO price response to macro shift, you MUST state this 
explicitly and hypothesize why (e.g., narrative was risk-off, offsetting 
dovish macro impact).
```

### Agent 2 Prompt Addition
```
MACRO INFLECTION VALIDATION TASK:
Agent 1 identified [X] macro regime shifts. For each one:

1. State the date of macro shift
2. Identify corresponding technical breakout/breakdown date  
3. Calculate lag in days
4. Assess alignment quality (strong/moderate/weak)

Create a validation table:
Macro Event | Date | Technical Response | Lag | Quality
------------|------|-------------------|-----|--------
[example]   | Dec 8| RSI >70 breakout  | +1d | Strong

Then calculate average lag and correlation strength.
```

### Agent 3 Prompt Addition
```
PATTERN LIBRARY REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST identify minimum 3 patterns with this exact structure:

### Pattern [N]: "[Descriptive Name]"
**Conditions:**
- Macro: [specific thresholds from Agent 1 data]
- Market: [specific indicators from Agent 2 data]  
- Narrative: [specific sentiment/themes from your data]

**Occurrences:** [X] times in 53-day window
[List specific date ranges]

**Outcome:**
[Quantified results: price change %, duration, success rate]

**Mechanism:**
[Causal explanation in 2-3 sentences]

If you cannot find 3 patterns, explain why and identify partial patterns.
```
