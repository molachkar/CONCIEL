Suggestion 1: Add a Validation Step
Before organizing your data files, create a checker that looks at each date folder and makes sure all six required files exist (calendar, fundamentals, technicals, calculos, news, forums). If any are missing, it should write this in a log file so you know which dates have incomplete data. This prevents your AI from making decisions with missing pieces.
Suggestion 2: Make Monthly Data More Accessible
Instead of keeping monthly_data.txt in a separate folder, either copy a snapshot of it into each daily folder, or create a small summary file that gets updated only when monthly indicators change (like when new CPI comes out). This way your AI models don't have to search two different locations.
Suggestion 3: Add Data Fingerprints
In each date folder, create a small file called manifest.json that records: what date this is, what time you processed the data, which source files were used, and whether all data is complete. Think of it like a receipt - later you can look back and know exactly what data was available on that day.
Suggestion 4: Create a Regime Detector
Build a small program that runs after the organizer and before the AI council. It should quickly scan the data and detect big changes like: Did CPI jump? Did VIX spike above 30? Did the Dollar break a major level? Did Gold and Stocks correlation flip? It outputs a simple answer: "RISK_ON", "RISK_OFF", or "CONSOLIDATION". This gives your AI council immediate context instead of forcing each model to re-analyze 40 days of history.
Suggestion 5: Build a Master Pipeline Script
Create one main program that runs everything in order: fetch data → split by date → validate → organize → detect regime → ready for AI. Each step should print status messages so you can see if something failed. This replaces running spliter.py and orginizer.py separately.
Suggestion 6: Add Quality Control Checks
Before the AI sees the data, run automatic checks: Is Gold price within reasonable range ($1800-$3000)? Is 10-Year Treasury rate believable (0%-10%)? Are there at least 5 news headlines? Is VIX under 100? If anything looks broken, flag it in a log. Don't let garbage data reach your AI models.
Suggestion 7: Create Visual Snapshots (Optional)
Build a simple HTML dashboard for each date that shows: a heatmap of which macro indicators are strong/weak, a chart of Gold vs Dollar, a timeline of important events, and sentiment scores. This isn't for the AI - it's for YOU to quickly eyeball whether the data looks reasonable before running the expensive AI council.
Suggestion 8: Package AI Input Better
Instead of making your AI models read six separate text files, create one clean JSON file per date that combines everything in a structured format. This ensures all 9 models see exactly identical data (no parsing differences) and reduces token usage because they're not re-reading headers and formatting from multiple files.
Suggestion 9: Build a Backtesting Engine
This is the most important addition. Take your historical data folders (all those dates in TEXT/data_by_date) and run your COUNCIL_BOT on them as if you were trading in the past. For each date, see what trade decision your system would have made, then check what Gold actually did in the following days. Track your win rate, average profit/loss, and whether your regime detection was accurate. This proves your multi-model system actually works instead of just being complicated.
Suggestion 10: Add Anomaly Alerts
Create a monitoring system that watches for weird patterns: duplicate data entries, timestamps from the future, sudden gaps in time series, or values that changed impossibly fast (like Gold jumping $500 in one day with no major event). When detected, send yourself an alert before the data gets to your AI.
These suggestions build layers of safety, efficiency, and validation around your core system. They don't change your excellent architecture - they just make it more robust and professional.
