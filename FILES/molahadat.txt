--> even if market news are more than gold and others do not let llm halocinate and give market more
scoring / weight or something like that, rather understanding the market more since its the 
first gold competetor.

--> the llm i need to test it first do you understad this data well, units, numbers, meanings, fractions,
everything data needed

--> economic calender mo, will fetch all news starting from the ongoing date all the way back 30 days
only for usd news, medium and high

--> fetch last thirty days daily candles of gold and spy to see its relation to news so the structure will be
like 15/10/2025 (news - social media - economic calender - daily ohclv - fundamentals). meaning it
will be a script will run the five scripts at ones, have access to all data and can read its contesnts,
make a news json file that follow that structure above.

--> when trading smaller time frrames we are going to take a look for depth of the market.

--> now i have economic calender for the last 30 days with title data and event 
+ fundamentals for daily frequence data i have prev month covered all, for other frequencies
i have just enough data.
+ marketechnicals i have 7d/24h/6h data high and low thats for support and resistance and technical
calculated, plus prev month opclv each day market data xauusd.
+ newssentiment finviz spy, vix, gold, usd, headlines for the last thirty days.
+ social media reddit sentiment and news.

+ i want to acumilate all the bots output into one output how is that, take the oldes date in our data
meaning one month older, go through all files and get what happened in that day, example 17/10/2025,
economic calender bot gives eneven with data, save it to that day then fundamentals bot gives also data to that date,
also for marketch 30d ohclv data, news for all tickers and social media, once we collect data for that date we move one 
to the next one 18, se if there is a corresponding data, and goes on all the way to the todays date,
at the end i will get an emens data set orginzed and filterd by date, ready to discuss and build our daily bais
and predictions
--> first : i need a main that runs the bots at once.
--> second : a bot that gets json files and accumilate them all.

--> only after that i will go to make a coinciel llm.


ok now that i have five different bots, one collect fundamentals, one collects economic calender, on for market data and calculating techincals, one for news sentiment and one for social media sentiment, i need a main that run them all at ones
