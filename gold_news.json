But there is still enormous potential for future growth.</p>\n\n<p>That potential is widely acknowledged, not least by the Chinese authorities. And they, along with others, recognise that the path to further expansion involves liberalisation, improved regulation and internationalisation.</p>\n\n<p>Initial steps have already been taken but much more action is planned over the coming decade and beyond. This has implications in many areas.</p>\n\n<p>In this edition of Gold Investor, we explore those implications and assess the outlook for China across a range of perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Zhou, Associate Dean at the world-renowned Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance, considers how best to leverage past lessons as China develops its financial markets in a world characterised by widespread geopolitical tension.</p>\n\n<p>Within China’s financial markets, the insurance industry now manages US$2 trillion (tn) of assets, following a decade of rapid growth. The Insurance Asset Management&nbsp;Association of China explains why this fast-growing sector might benefit from investing some of its US$2tn assets in gold.</p>\n\n<p>We also examine ways in which stronger market infrastructure and improved regulation would boost confidence in China’s gold investment industry, following an in-depth report from one of China’s leading think-tanks, the Financial Research Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council.</p>\n\n<p>The China Gold Association echoes the need for more robust regulation, suggesting that the mining industry can become a prominent player on the international stage, if it becomes both more disciplined and more outward facing.</p>\n\n<p>The “Belt and Road” initiative has become a symbol of China’s international ambition and its deepening relationship with emerging markets worldwide. Xiao Fu, Head of Commodity Markets’ Strategy at Bank of China International, considers progress to date and the considerable impact that this extensive project will have on the gold market.</p>\n\n<p>Any comprehensive view of China’s gold market would not be complete without an analysis of its jewellery industry, the largest in the world by some margin. Chow Tai Fook, one of country’s most prominent retailers, believes prospects are bright but acknowledges that the industry has to make both structural and strategic changes to attract younger, affluent customers.</p>\n\n<p>I have watched China develop at an extraordinary pace during my years as Chief Executive of the World Gold Council. Today, the focus of the gold market has shifted definitely from West to East with China at the forefront. It is increasingly taking a leadership position worldwide. This is reflected in the increased number of Chinese mining companies that are becoming members of the World Gold Council. To facilitate their active participation on the Board of the Council, we have created the China Chapter which is chaired by Mr Song, the Chairman of China Gold International Resources Corp Ltd and also of the China Gold Association. The China Chapter also provides a platform for China’s leading gold miners and market leaders to guide and engage in our programmes at the highest level.</p>\n\n<p>We are always keen to hear your views about Gold Investor so please email us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:goldinvestor@gold.org\">goldinvestor@gold.org</a>.

Admired for its beauty and treasured for its economic value, gold’s unique attributes have been recognised for thousands of years.</p></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  <div class=\"l-col-bleed l-col-md-9\">\n      \n  \n\n\n\n<figure class=\"a-image a-image--brand-border\">\n  \n        \n        \n    <img alt=\"Gold in the Global Economy: Market, mining and modernisation\" src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/default/files/styles/webp/public/2025-11/1_6.png.webp?itok=wGg9RLMp\" />\n  \n\n  </figure>\n\n    <hr class=\"a-spacer\" />\n  </div>\n  \n        \n  <div class=\"l-col-bleed l-col-md-9\">\n    <div class=\"wgc-text\">\n    <p>Today, those attributes continue to define and differentiate gold. Prized by investors, cherished by consumers and deployed in a range of technological applications, gold is an asset like no other, contributing to cultural traditions, financial stability, wealth creation and industrial markets.</p><p>In recent years, recognition of gold’s unique characteristics has propelled annual consumption to record levels of almost 5,000 tonnes per annum, fuelled by demand from consumers, investors, central banks and industrial users. Around three-quarters of that demand is satisfied by newly mined gold, yet supply increases by little more than 1.5% annually, providing a favourable long-term backdrop for the market.&nbsp;</p><p>Supply growth is constrained for multiple reasons, not least because gold miners tend to operate in some of the most remote and challenging regions of the world. In spite of these tough operating conditions, responsible miners can make a real difference, contributing approximately US$60 billion annually to host economies, including taxes, employee wages, and payments to local communities and suppliers.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, producers, refiners and retailers of gold are under scrutiny like never before. Stakeholders are calling for more robust environmental, social and governance (ESG) processes and this has led to sustained and consistent progress.&nbsp;</p><p>This report analyses gold’s role in the global economy – from those who mine and refine it to those who cherish it, invest in it and make use of it. Analysing supply and demand trends across the globe, our report makes three central observations:</p><ol><li>Interest in gold is broad, deep and growing, fuelled by demand from sovereign states, investors, savers and consumers.</li><li>Gold mining can deliver widespread social, economic and environmental benefits, when supported by advances in technology and new operational models.</li><li>Challenges persist across the gold industry, but these present an opportunity to drive change through innovation and ensure that gold is a fit-for-the-future asset.</li></ol>\n\n</div>\n\n    <hr class=\"a-spacer\" />\n  </div>\n  \n        \n  <div class=\"l-col-bleed l-col-md-9\">\n    <div class=\"wgc-text\">\n    <h3>Evolution in demand&nbsp;</h3><p>Economic, social and geopolitical trends have contributed to fundamental shifts in demand for gold. Across the globe, rising tensions and financial market uncertainties are fuelling interest among institutional investors and retail savers, supported by increased ease of access to physical gold and gold-backed funds. Among central banks, there has been sustained gold buying since the Global Financial Crisis, accelerating still further in recent years. In China and India, rising wealth has fostered retail appetite for bars, coins and jewellery, reinforcing gold’s cultural and financial significance across Asia. And in industry, gold’s durability, conductivity and malleability make it a core component of AI infrastructure and other advanced technologies.</p><p>Even as demand flows evolve across the globe, the supply chain is also undergoing unprecedented change.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n    <hr class=\"a-spacer\" />\n  </div>\n  \n        \n  <div class=\"l-col-bleed l-col-md-9\">\n      \n  \n\n\n\n<figure class=\"a-image a-image--brand-border\">\n  \n        \n        \n    <img alt=\"gold\" src=\"https://www.gold.org/sites/default/files/styles/webp/public/2025-11/gold_0.png.webp?itok=HOQE-Ksj\" />\n  \n\n  </figure>\n\n    <hr class=\"a-spacer\" />\n  </div>\n  \n        \n  <div class=\"l-col-bleed l-col-md-9\">\n    <div class=\"wgc-text\">\n    <h3>Supply chain in the spotlight</h3><p>Amid growing calls for tangible evidence of responsible practice along the value chain, gold miners are at the forefront of technological and operational innovations to reduce harmful emissions, drive efficiency, forge stronger partnerships with local communities and root out criminal activity.</p><p>Much has been achieved but challenges remain. Gold’s value as a trusted asset does not just depend on its intrinsic qualities but also on how it is produced, refined, sold and stored. Transparency, responsible sourcing and environmental performance have become critical considerations, defining gold’s legitimacy among regulators, responsible investors, lenders and consumers.</p><p>This creates a series of challenges for the gold industry, as it strives to deliver ESG change, while responding to a fast-moving regulatory environment.Innovation can provide many of the answers. But&nbsp;industry players are under growing pressure to ensure&nbsp;they are abreast of new developments and can adapt&nbsp;swiftly to stakeholder demands.&nbsp;</p><p>The opportunity is clear: gold that can prove its origin,&nbsp;integrity, and sustainability, will strengthen its position&nbsp;as a credible, resilient asset in a changing financial&nbsp;landscape. The long-term relevance of gold depends&nbsp;not just on being scarce — but on being trusted,&nbsp;transparent, and responsible.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n    <hr class=\"a-spacer\" />\n  </div>\n  \n        \n  <div class=\"l-col-bleed l-col-md-9\">\n    \n\n<section class=\"o-box\">\n    <div class=\"wgc-text\">\n    <h2>Gold in the Global Economy: Market, mining and modernisation</h2>\n\n</div>\n\n  <div class=\"wgc-text\">\n    <p>This report makes four key points:</p><ol><li>The value of gold is recognised globally, evidenced by rising and widespread demand.</li><li>The gold industry faces growing calls for change.</li><li>Key players are already adapting their models and delivering on their obligations, capitalising on&nbsp;<br />technology and cross-industry learnings.</li><li>Now the entire industry must follow suit, adopting new processes, exploring new partnerships and driving transparency along the supply chain.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Gold plays a critical role in socioeconomic growth, financial stability and cultural traditions.

This evolution reflects a growing understanding that climate stability and social development cannot be achieved without safeguarding ecosystems and the services they provide.</p><p>In our new report, <em><strong>Gold, Nature and Biodiversity: An Introduction</strong></em>, we apply the Nature Risk Profile methodology—developed by <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/sustainable1/\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Global Sustainable1</a> (our research partners) and<a href=\"https://www.unep-wcmc.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> UNEP-WCMC</a>—to a sample of 122 gold mines across multiple continents and biomes. This framework, aligned with TNFD’s LEAP approach, enables standardised comparisons of ecological impacts and dependencies across diverse site and geographies.</p><p>While the majority of gold mine sites were, perhaps surprisingly, found to exhibit relatively low ecosystem impact, a subset of mines—including those overlapping with protected or ecologically significant areas—were flagged as being of higher impact or significance. Closer examination of the local implications of these findings underscores the importance of targeted risk management and the need to understand nature’s contribution not only to biodiversity but also to local communities.</p><p>Importantly, complementing high-level analysis with site-level insights and an examination of company disclosures, reveals a range of practical responses and adaptive strategies that may not be evident from top-down metrics. These localised perspectives help illuminate what ‘good practice’ looks like in real-world contexts and offer a firm foundation for more coherent understanding of gold industry’s nature-related impacts.</p><p>We regard this work as a further step toward a more cohesive and integrated sustainability research agenda and hope it will further encourage meaningful industry initiatives to enhance the health and resilience of the ecosystems surrounding gold mining operations.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n    <hr class=\"a-spacer\" />\n  </div>\n  \n        \n  <div class=\"l-col-bleed l-col-md-9\">\n    \n\n<section class=\"o-box\">\n    <div class=\"wgc-text\">\n    <h2 id=\"report\">Gold, Nature and Biodiversity: An Introduction</h2>\n\n</div>\n\n  <div class=\"wgc-text\">\n    <p>Our research on Gold, Nature and Biodiversity combines the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>An application of the Nature Risk Profile methodology (developed by S&amp;P Global and UNEP) to 122 different gold mine sites of different types (approximately 60% open pit, 40% underground), located across 6 continents, in a range of ecosystems and biomes.</li><li>An examination, referencing the impact metrics from the above analysis, of 15 local mine site-level responses, plans and projects seeking to contribute to risk mitigation, and positive improvement in biodiversity and ecosystem services.</li><li>A consideration of the implications and main drivers of progress for the wider gold mining sector, including how disclosures are positioned and received by industry stakeholders and analysts.</li></ul>\n\n</div>\n\n  \n\n\n<div>\n  \n\n        <h3>To read more, download the report below:</h3>\n\n\n    <hr class=\"a-spacer a-spacer--xxs\" />\n    \n  <div class=\"m-grid\">\n      \n\n\n\n        \n<a class=\"a-download download  pdf\" href=\"https://www.gold.org/download/file/20050/Gold_Nature_and_Biodiversity-2-Page-Summary.pdf\">\n  <div class=\"a-download__info\">\n      Gold, Nature and Biodiversity: An Introduction - Summary\n\n    <div class=\"a-download__meta\">\n      PDF\n              <span class=\"a-download__size\">  0.59 mb</span>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</a>\n\n  \n\n\n\n        \n<a class=\"a-download download  pdf\" href=\"https://www.gold.org/download/file/20051/Gold_Nature_and_Biodiversity_An_Introduction.pdf\">\n  <div class=\"a-download__info\">\n      Gold, Nature and Biodiversity: An Introduction - Full Report\n\n    <div class=\"a-download__meta\">\n      PDF\n              <span class=\"a-download__size\">  5.65 mb</span>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</a>\n\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n</section>\n\n    <hr class=\"a-spacer\" />\n  </div>\n            <div>1</div>\n                  <div>0</div>\n                  <div>0</div>\n                  <div>md</div>",
